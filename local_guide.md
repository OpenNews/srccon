## How to Get Around

There are two train lines in the Twin Cities. One runs through Minneapolis and the other runs from Minneapolis to St. Paul. Mercifully, they are connected. The [MetroTransit trip planner](https://www.metrotransit.org/imap/map.aspx) is a reliable way to determine if your destination is near a train stop. Many of the places listed here are. Metro Transit, the agency that runs buses and trains in Minneapolis, [has an app](https://www.metrotransit.org/app) (iOS and Android) so you can buy fares right on your phone (buses and train stations also take cash, but have exact change).

There is also a bike sharing system called [Nice Ride](https://www.niceridemn.org/) that has over 100 stations throughout the core cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Stations are usually pretty close to many of the attractions listed below, including right behind the McNamara Center. Passes are $6 for 24 hours or $15 for a month, you get bikes for 60 minutes at a time before additional fees accrue.

2.4 miles  
2325 Endicott Street, St. Paul  
This is a 10-15 minute walk from the Raymond Avenue stop (3 stops east of Stadium Village). It’s a little off the beaten path and surrounded by warehouses but worth a visit.  
A woman-owned and operated craft brewery that makes damn good beer and features a small but strong food menu. Two taprooms and a nice patio.

### Peace Coffee

[http://www.peacecoffee.com/locations/wonderland-park](http://www.peacecoffee.com/locations/wonderland-park)  
2.8 miles  
3262 Minnehaha Avenue  
If going out of your way for good coffee is a thing you do, it's worth doing it for this place. The specialty drinks are bananas.

### Sociable Cider Werks

[http://sociablecider.com/](http://sociablecider.com/)  
2.8 miles  
1500 Fillmore St NE  
It’s hard to throw a growler in NE Minneapolis without hitting a brewery, but if you’re looking for cider (or just gluten free options) Sociable is your place.

### Young Joni

[https://www.youngjoni.com/](https://www.youngjoni.com/)  
2.8 miles  
165 13th Ave NE  
One of the more buzzed about restaurants to open recently, featuring pizzas and Asian-influenced sides and salads. You probably need a reservation to get in the dining room, but there’s also a back bar with a more limited menu (expect a line).

### 112 Eatery

[http://www.112eatery.com](http://www.112eatery.com)  
2.9 miles  
112 North 3rd Street

[http://tattersalldistilling.com/](http://tattersalldistilling.com/)  
2.9 miles

Arguably the best cocktails in the Twin Cities, in a beautiful space. Can get busy on weekend nights. No food, but there’s usually a food truck parked outside.

### Fasika (Ethiopian)

[http://www.fasika.com/welcome.html](http://www.fasika.com/welcome.html)  
3.4 miles  
510 N Snelling Ave

2506 Central Ave NE  
Cooperative brewery with a penchant for sour beers. Great food options abound in the neighborhood; feel free to bring in your take out.

### Pimento Jamaican Kitchen

[http://pimentokitchen.com/](http://pimentokitchen.com/)  
3.5 miles  
2524 Nicollet Ave  
Casual Jamaican. This concept was a one-time winner of "Food Court Wars," but don’t let that deter you — it’s good.

### Chimborazo

[http://chimborazorestaurant.com/](http://chimborazorestaurant.com/)  
3.8 miles  
2851 Central Avenue NE  
Excellent Ecuadorean food on Central Ave, which is a great eating street in general.

### Matt's Bar

[http://mattsbar.com](http://mattsbar.com)  
3.9 miles  
3500 Cedar Avenue  
This is the place you go for the local novelty food: The Jucy Lucy (yes, that is how they spell it). It's also where, not too long ago, POTUS went for the local novelty food. Here's the thing: This novelty is also a legitimately great burger. And Matt's a legitimately great dive. (The other claimant to the "Jucy Lucy" title is the 5-8 Club, a restaurant and bar on the same road but farther south, near the airport.)

### Hola Arepa

[http://holaarepa.com/](http://holaarepa.com/)  
4.6 miles  
3501 Nicollet Ave  
Food-truck turned brick and mortar focusing on Venezuelan-style arepa sandwiches and a creative cocktail list.

### Khyber Pass Cafe (Afghan)

The chutney sampler--oh my. And anything with lamb in it.

### Angry Catfish Bicycle and Coffee Bar

[http://angrycatfishbicycle.com](http://angrycatfishbicycle.com)  
5.4 miles  
4208 South 28th Avenue  
If you like your coffee snobs humble, this is your place. This is fussy coffee at its fussiest, and it is a beautiful thing.

### Bryant Lake Bowl & Theater

[http://www.bryantlakebowl.com/](http://www.bryantlakebowl.com/)  
5.25 miles  
810 West Lake St.  
At the heart of the walkable LynLake area—food, drink, bowling, and shows.

### Sea Salt (Seafood)

[https://seasalteatery.wordpress.com](https://seasalteatery.wordpress.com)  
6.4 miles  
4825 Minnehaha Avenue  
Let's be honest—this is Minnesota, so we are also talking *lake* food. But you know what? Lake food is delicious and you'll be eating it at an outdoor table within earshot (and from some tables within eyeshot) of Minnehaha Falls. And the whole thing is just a short walk from a lightrail stop.

### Ha Tien Market

7.4 miles  
353 University Avenue West, St. Paul  
Just off the Western Ave station on the Green line. This has the best banh mi, the other one is good but this is better, and it’s a full Vietnamese grocery as well.

<span id="sights"></span>

## Beautiful places

### Guthrie Theater

[http://www.guthrietheater.org](http://www.guthrietheater.org)  
2.2 miles  
818 South 2nd Street  
The Guthrie was built for plays, but anybody can walk in anytime. Their "Endless Bridge" overlooks the Mississippi River and the ruins of the city's flour milling industry, but it may still be closed for repairs during SRCCON.

### Gold Medal Park

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Medal_Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Medal_Park)  
2.2 miles  
Gold Medal Park is a lovely picnic spot. Its right next to the Guthrie, which means you can also get in on the magic of the Endless Bridge. It's also right by Izzy's Ice Cream (see above). Seriously--it is your destiny.

### Paddle the Mississippi River

[http://paddleshare.org/](http://paddleshare.org/)  
Kayak sharing (and all the other gear, like lifejackets paddles & more)! You don't need any of your own equipment, just make an online reservation and off you go. Along the Mississippi River, kayakers will pass natural sights like the heron rookery and other islands amid industrial yards and city infrastructure on a transitioning Minneapolis waterfront. They can also stop for dockside dining at places like Sample Room and Psycho Suzi's.

### Marjorie McNeely Conservatory

[http://www.comozooconservatory.org/](http://www.comozooconservatory.org/)  
(Minneapolis) 5.8 miles  
200 SE Oak  
A beautiful spot in Como Park with some amazing plant displays—while there, stop around to the lakeside—specifically Spring Café or Sweet Science ice cream at the Como Park Pavilion.

### Minnehaha Falls

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnehaha_Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnehaha_Park)  
(Minneapolis) 5.2 miles  
4825 Minnehaha Avenue  
A waterfall, hiking trails, and a great seafood restauraunt. Oh, and you can rent those crazy four-person bikes and pretend you are in the things-are'splendid montage of a romantic comedy!

### Walker Art Center Sculpture Garden

[https://www.walkerart.org/garden/#map-overview/](https://www.walkerart.org/garden/#map-overview/)  
4.5 miles  
1750 Hennepin Avenue  
You know that giant spoon with a giant cherry in it that appears on postcards and special broadcasts from Minneapolis? This is where it lives. And that is fine—it's kind of cool. But there is so much more at the Walker Art Center's sculpture garden.

### University of Minnesota Landscape Arboretum

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Landscape_Arboretum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Landscape_Arboretum)  
26.4 miles  
3675 Arboretum Drive, Chaska, MN  
If you need a quiet place for a stroll, or just want to sit and think while surrounded by pretty growy things, you might think about the arboretum. It's a rental-car thing for sure, but there's also a Prince perk: To get there you drive by Paisley Park.

### Mississippi River via Padelford Riverboats

[http://www.riverrides.com/](http://www.riverrides.com/)  
Dr Justus Ohage Blvd, St Paul  
9.7 miles  
A river boat ride on the Mississippi between Minneapolis and St. Paul.

### Chain of Lakes

[http://www.wheelfunrentals.com/Locations/Minneapolis](http://www.wheelfunrentals.com/Locations/Minneapolis)  
3000 E. Calhoun Pkwy  
5.7 miles  
Fittingly enough, the biggest city in the Land of 10,000 Lakes features quite a few lakes of its own. Four of them — Lake Harriet, Lake Calhoun/Bde Maka Ska, Lake of the Isles and Cedar Lake — are connected by continuous parkland and feature pedestrian and bike trails.  You can also rent bikes, pedal boats, kayaks, canoes, and paddleboards for lake-splashing enjoyment.

<span id="books"></span>

## Books!

These bookstores are vetted. There are plenty more that could (and maybe should) be on the list, but you can't go wrong with any of these (unless, of course, if you hate science fiction and decide to truck it out to Uncle Hugo's). Worth noting: Wild Rumpus is a bookstore for kids that has LIVE ANIMALS running around. And we're not just talking about bookstore cats. There are chickens!

<span id="records"></span>

## Records!

Like the bookstores, these record stores are vetted! Three things worth noting: Fifth Element is the record store of the Minneapolis Hip Hop collective Rhymesayers (Atmosphere, Brother Ali, P.O.S.), Electric Fetus is a super gross name and a really great store, and Treehouse used to be called Oar Folkjokeopus and was sort of the uniffial HQ of Twin/Tone records, early home to Minneapolis bands like The Replacements, Babes in Toyland, Soul Asylum, and The Jayhawks. It's also where the guys from Husker Du met.

5.9 miles  
4001 Bryant Ave S  
The Twin Cities’ only "listening room," the Warming House is a forty-seat venue below a bike shop. There’s no booze on sale, which has the advantage of people coming to actually listen to the mostly acoustic and Americana focused acts.

<span id="kids"></span>

## Fun for Kids!

### Minnesota Children’s Museum

[http://www.mcm.org/](http://www.mcm.org/)  
7.5 miles  
10 7th St. W., St. Paul  
Essential, especially because they just re-opened June 2017 after a massive renovation and expansion. Ideal for toddlers to age 8, but we’re hearing that some of the new exhibits will cater to kids even a little older than that.

### Como Zoo

[http://www.comozooconservatory.org/](http://www.comozooconservatory.org/)  
5.9 miles  
1225 Estabrook Drive, St Paul  
Small, but really nice, zoo; a conservatory; a really cool historical carousel (to ride!); and an amusement park called Como Town that has rides and a splash pad. The rides are geared toward younger kids (toddler through middle school). Como Town and the carousel cost money, but the zoo is free (they ask for donations, however).

### The Works Museum

### Ax-Man Surplus Store

1639 University Avenue West  
The most freakishly delightful surplus store this side of the Mississippi. Not military surplus, but *everything* surplus. People walk through the aisles making joyful sounds. For real.

### Prince sites

[http://www.exploreminnesota.com/travel-ideas/prince-tour-of-minneapolis/](http://www.exploreminnesota.com/travel-ideas/prince-tour-of-minneapolis/)  
Since the death of Prince in April 2016, a sort of "tour" of key sites has developed. The biggest destination is Paisley Park, which offers daily tours. Paisely Park is located in a suburb south of Minneapolis called Chanhassen. (Sorry the trains don’t run that far).  The link above has details and a list of other sites that Prince fans have been visiting.

### Can Can Wonderland

[http://www.cancanwonderland.com/](http://www.cancanwonderland.com/)  
Located in St. Paul, right on the border with Minneapolis, this is a new venue for adults to be more like kids. Mini golf, amusements, bar and restaurant, arts-based flora and fauna. Unfortunately it’s not close to the train line, but would be a short cab or Uber ride from the conference hotel.

### Franconia Sculpture Park

[http://www.franconia.org](http://www.franconia.org)  
47.5 miles  
29836 Saint Croix Trail, Shafer, MN  
There is a house suspended from wires, a sculpture made of boom boxes that reaches towards the heavens... Many of the sculptures are welded, formed, and banged together on site. It's sprawling and it's amazing.

### Duluth (Lake Superior)

150 miles  
It's a 2.5-hour drive, but it's a great little city on a really big lake. If you are a Dylan person, he was born in Duluth and lived there at 519 N. 3rd Ave. E. until he was six. Or maybe you are a Prince person...
