**The application window for travel scholarships to SRCCON 2016 is now closed. Thank you so much to everyone who applied.**

## Apply for a scholarship
We&rsquo;re accepting applications for a limited number of scholarships from May 5 to May 18.

Whether you&rsquo;re a newsroom developer at a small organization with a strained professional development budget or a freelance developer eager to learn more about journalism code, we want to help you attend SRCCON.

## What we&rsquo;re offering
Scholarships include a ticket to SRCCON and $500 for you to use toward the cost of travel to the event. We also have an extremely small number of $1,000 scholarships available for participants with much higher travel costs. (For scholarship recipients who live in the Portland area, we offer a SRCCON ticket without the additional travel funding.)

We are also offering five scholarships for Dow Jones News Fund alumni. That scholarship opportunity is also now closed.

## Who should apply
* Anyone who is part of the journalism code community
* Anyone interested in learning more about the journalism code community
* People of color, women, and other underrepresented groups in technology are strongly encouraged to apply

## What happens after you apply?
We&rsquo;ll review your application and get back to you by May 20.

## What happens after SRCCON?
You tell us how it went! We&rsquo;ll send you a short followup survey and will be excited to check out any blog posts or code repos that come out of your participation at SRCCON.

## Why are you offering these scholarships?
We want to make sure that SRCCON is an event that includes the diversity of the communities we serve&mdash;geographically, demographically, experientially, and more. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that.

## How do you decide who will receive a scholarship?
OpenNews staff reviews all applications. We prioritize applications from members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology, as well as from people who would be unable to facilitate an accepted session without the scholarship.

## Do I still need to purchase a ticket to SRCCON?
If you receive a scholarship, you will not have to purchase a ticket. We will notify you about the status of your application before registration closes for the SRCCON lottery.

## When will I receive my scholarship?
When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship funds. In short, you will need to send us an invoice, and our administrators will process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.

## What if I need more than $500 for my travel?
We're able to offer mostly $500 scholarships at this time. This year, we are also offering an extremely small number of $1,000 scholarships for exceptionally high travel costs. We've added a question to the form to capture more information about the level of need for travel costs.

## What are other ways I can cover the cost of my travel?
Luckily, Portland is a relatively cheap city once you arrive. Also, this entire site is a [GitHub pages repo](https://github.com/OpenNews/srccon), so if you, say, wanted to add a link to a room-share board, you could go right ahead and do that. Or you can [email with any suggestions](erika@opennews.org).
