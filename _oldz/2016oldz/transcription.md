It's important to us to keep SRCCON small enough to feel friendly and conversational, but we also care about getting the ideas and conversations that take place at SRCCON into the wider world. The most important way this happens is when attendees return to their home newsrooms and put their new skills and approaches to work, but we are also documenting SRCCON as extensively as possible.

## Transcription

We had a live-captioning team transcribe 26 sessions at SRCCON. Live streams were available during these sessions, and links to the cleaned-up archives appear below.

<div>
    <h3>Thursday sessions</h3>
    <table>{% assign thursday = site.data.schedule | where:"day","Thursday" %}
{% for session in thursday %}
        {% if session.transcription != "" %}<tr><td>{{ session.time }}</td><td><a href="/transcriptions/SRCCON2016-{{ session.id }}">{{ session.title }}</a></td></tr>{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
    </table>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Friday sessions</h3>
    <table>{% assign friday = site.data.schedule | where:"day","Friday" %}
{% for session in friday %}
        {% if session.transcription != "" %}<tr><td>{{ session.time }}</td><td><a href="/transcriptions/SRCCON2016-{{ session.id }}">{{ session.title }}</a></td></tr>{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
    </table>
</div>

## Write-Ups

During and after SRCCON, we have a documentation team writing up session summaries, collecting resource lists, and more. We'll be [publishing the write-ups on Source](https://source.opennews.org) in the weeks that follow the conference, and also collecting write-ups and blog posts from attendees.
