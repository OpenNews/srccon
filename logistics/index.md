<p class="bodybig">Join us in Old City Philadelphia July 24 & 25 for the first annual SRCCON. Two days of making, thinking, and talking together. We can&rsquo;t wait for you to join us.</p>

###The Venue
SRCCON will take place at the [Chemical Heritage Foundation](http://www.chemheritage.org/), a museum and event space in the Old City neighborhood of Philadelphia.

###Hotels
We will have a hotel registration link soon for $179/night rooms just a few blocks away from the venue. Old City is filled with hotels, shops, restaurants, bars, and&mdash;as the name suggests&mdash;plenty o&rsquo; historical sites.

###Getting to the Venue
Philly is very well-served by the [Philadelphia International Airport](http://www.phl.org/Pages/HomePage.aspx), [Amtrak&rsquo;s 30th Street Station](http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=am/am2Station/Station_Page&code=PHL), and [numerous](http://megabus.com/) [bus](http://www.gotobus.com/yobus/) [companies](https://www.greyhound.com/default.aspx).
There is a public transit train (called regional rail) from the airport to Center City (downtown area). Tickets are $6.50 if you buy from a kiosk on the platform or $8 if purchased on the train. Get off at the &ldquo;Market East&rdquo; stop and you&rsquo;ll be a short walk from the venue.

###Scholarships for SRCCON
We offer a small number of $500 travel scholarships to attendees for whom the cost to attend would otherwise be prohibitive. Travel scholarship [applications are open](/scholarships) until June 13.

###Contributing to SRCCON
We hope that you've [purchased a ticket](/register) and [submitted a session proposal](/sessions). In addition to preparing yourself for two days of great conversations and building, we appreciate your help spreading the word about SRCCON. If you know someone who might love SRCCON but may not have heard about it, please invite that person.

We're also looking for a small number of [volunteers during the event](/volunteer). If you cannot attend in SRCCON in person, we're as bummed as you are.

We're going to do our best to document the event and share it back with the entire community. [Please let us know](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) if you have suggestions for ways for us to support remote or asynchronous participation.

###**While in Philly**
We didn&rsquo;t want you stuck in a conference hotel that could have been anywhere, so we picked a centrally located venue for SRCCON. We encourage you to explore Philadelphia while you&rsquo;re in town. Within five blocks of the Chemical Heritage Foundation are numerous historical sites, museums, bars, restaurants, and entertaining people watching (think: Colonial [LARPing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game)). If you&rsquo;d like to venture beyond the Old City neighborhood, check out the transit information below, rent a bike, or keep walking till you hit one of the rivers that bookends downtown Philly.

###Transit
Old City is accessible via bus and subway on public transit. The local transit organization is [SEPTA](http://septa.org). The closest subway station is the 2nd Street Market-Frankford Line (also known as &ldquo;the El&rdquo; or &ldquo;blue line&rdquo;) stop, and numerous bus lines run on Market Street, which is one block north of the venue. Philly still uses tokens to pay for transit rides. Tokens are $1.80 and are available for purchase at many, but not all, subway and train stations. Cash fare for bus and subway rides is $2.25 with a transfer costing $1. Regional rail trains, which serve the airport and farther out stations, are charged by a [zone system](http://septa.org/fares/ticket/index.html).

SEPTA open data led the civic hackathon movement in Philadelphia so there are a plethora of apps to access transit schedules and information.

In addition to public transit, the Old City area is exceptionally walkable, biking is quite common, and cabs are plentiful.

###Food
The Chemical Heritage Foundation is a block away from a restaurant from [Jose Garces](http://philadelphia.amadarestaurant.com/), one of the current Iron Chefs, that has a pretty delectable lunch menu. Within five blocks is another Garces restaurant as well as a restaurant by another Iron Chef and countless BYOBs, farm to table loving restaurants, a Chinese restaurant originated in Philly that got NYMag plaudits, pizza joints, old-timey ice cream parlors, and cheesesteak shops. On the BYOB point, there is a state store to buy wine and liquor (Pennsylvania restricts the sale of alcohol) two blocks from the venue at 32 S. 2nd Street where you can pick up wine on the way to dinner.

###Beer
Philly is a big beer city, with several breweries and numerous bars and restaurants with extensive beer selections. Within 5 blocks of the venue are [Eulogy Belgian Tavern](http://eulogybar.com/) with an enourmous beer listing and [Victory Brewing Company](http://www.victorybeer.com/) with a brewery in the bar. Old City has a bustling nightlife, especially on weekends, and bars that cater to all types of groups (including &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Always Sunny&rdquo; fans).

###Coffee
Philly is well-known for La Colombe coffee, which is available in many coffee shops and restaurants. We will have a range of coffee rigs Thursday and Friday morning for you to brew your favorite style of coffee as well.

###Child care
We&rsquo;re researching options on how to support attendees who need childcare. Please note your interest in childcare on your registration or email us. We&rsquo;ll post more details soon.

###Hacker/maker spaces
Philly has several [hacker and maker spaces](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Philadelphia), which are all a relatively quick transit ride from the venue.

###Want more info?
We&rsquo;re still building out this page so if you have any questions, just [email Erika Owens](mailto:erika@mozillafoundation.org) and we&rsquo;ll research your question and update the site.
