SRCCON is a hands-on conference focused on the practical challenges news technology and data teams encounter every day. We work to make it an inclusive and welcoming event where people can feel comfortable digging into complex problems. This year, SRCCON included more than 50 sessions on a wide range of topics, from tech strategies to workplace culture struggles.

## Who attends SRCCON

The majority of SRCCON participants are developers, designers, and data analysts who work in newsrooms. We also enthusiastically welcome attendees from closely allied fields like civic tech, mapping, open data, and government—and others who are curious about journalism and excited to share their expertise at a journalism-centric conference.

Our participants represent organizations ranging from massive to tiny, and come from all over the US and many other countries. Each year, we particulary welcome journalists and allies from the city hosting SRCCON, and we're working to build better remote-participation options for those who can't attend in person.

SRCCON is produced by [Knight-Mozilla OpenNews](http://opennews.org), an organization built to support the community of news developers, designers, and data analysts helping journalism thrive on the open web.

The “src” in SRCCON stands for “Source,” as in "view source." We pronounce it “Source-con,” but you can say it however you want.
