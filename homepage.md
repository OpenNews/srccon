## About SRCCON

SRCCON is a hands-on conference, full of conversations and workshops focused on the practical challenges that news technology and data teams encounter every day. We work to make it an inclusive and welcoming event where people can feel comfortable digging into complex problems. Last year SRCCON included nearly 300 attendees and more than 50 sessions that covered a wide range of topics, from tech strategies to workplace culture struggles.

## Who attends SRCCON

The majority of SRCCON participants are developers, designers, and data analysts who work in newsrooms. We also enthusiastically welcome attendees from closely allied fields like civic tech, mapping, open data, and others who are curious about journalism and excited to share their expertise at a journalism-centric conference.

Our participants represent organizations ranging from massive to tiny, and come from all over the US and many other countries. Each year, we particularly welcome journalists and allies from the city hosting SRCCON, and we're working to build better remote-participation options for those who can't attend in person.

## About us

SRCCON is produced by [OpenNews](https://opennews.org). We connect a network of developers, designers, journalists and editors to collaborate on open technologies and processes within journalism. OpenNews believes that a community of peers working, learning and solving problems together can create a stronger, more responsive, and ascendant journalism ecosystem. Incubated at the [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/) from 2011-2016, OpenNews is now a project of [Community Partners](http://www.communitypartners.org/).

The “src” in SRCCON stands for “Source,” as in "view source." We pronounce it “Source-con,” but you can say it however you want.
