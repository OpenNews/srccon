<div id="about-srccon-events" class="page-divider"><span>About SRCCON events</span></div>

SRCCON events are highly participatory and inclusive, where participants come first so they can can feel comfortable digging into complex problems. We organize the schedule around hands-on sessions, conversations, and workshops focused on the practical challenges that news technology and data teams encounter every day.

Session topics come from the community, with OpenNews providing the intentional space that takes care of participants and allows them to develop open, interdependent relationships with each other.

SRCCON events are produced by [OpenNews](https://opennews.org). We connect a network of developers, designers, journalists, and editors to collaborate on open technologies and processes within journalism. OpenNews believes that a community of peers working, learning and solving problems together can create a stronger, more responsive, and inclusive journalism ecosystem. Incubated at the [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/) from 2011-2016, OpenNews is now a project of [Community Partners](http://communitypartners.org/).
