# Thank you, SRCCON 2018 attendees!

This was our largest conference ever, and your ideas, your passions, and all the ways you spent two days in community with each other created an incredible experience for everyone there. You listened and learned, you worked through hard conversations, and we came out of SRCCON more resilient and ready to transform journalism where we live.

To help us all take some of SRCCON home, we’re collecting [session transcripts, resources, and Source writeups right here](/documentation). If the work that took place in our more than 50 sessions and workshops this year inspired you to try something new, [we'd love to hear about it](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) and help you share.

As we move forward into 2018, you can keep up with our plans for future SRCCON events [via email](https://opennews.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=71c95e9a43708843d2fdc1f09&id=996e9290cc) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/srccon). And we also invite you to [support our work financially](https://opennews.org/donate), to help OpenNews keep offering the guidance, the network, and the small group convening support that has helped this community grow.

## When & Where

SRCCON 2018 returned to the [McNamara Alumni Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/McNamara+Alumni+Center/@44.975199,-93.2301774,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52b32d18ed516031:0x5f984f594ceab6ad!8m2!3d44.975199!4d-93.2279887) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on June 28 & 29, with more than 50 sessions on how we experiment in the open, support one another, and lead change.

## About SRCCON

This year we are psyched to celebrate the [fifth SRCCON](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon-five/).

SRCCON is a hands-on conference, full of conversations and workshops focused on the practical challenges that news technology and data teams encounter every day. We work to make it an inclusive and welcoming event where people can feel comfortable digging into complex problems. Over two-days, 300 attendees will gather for [nearly 50 sessions](/sessions) that reflect the values of this community:

* **We experiment in the open**—by sharing our work and processes, we do the innovative work our organizations need to evolve on the web and better inform our audiences.
* **We support one another**—by offering each other our expertise and empathy, we find new collaborators, help each other learn, and make our networks and organizations more resilient.
* **We lead change**—by challenging the power structures that have failed our industry, we push for inclusive, long-lasting change in our newsrooms, led by journalists of color and the wide swath of journalists outside of NYC/DC.

## Who Attends SRCCON

The majority of SRCCON participants are the developers, designers, journalists, and editors who collaborate on open technologies and processes within journalism. Participants come to SRCCON because they are working to change journalism for the better, whether that be pushing for more inclusive processes, bringing outside technical perspectives into the newsroom, or developing new ways to engage and inform readers.

Our participants represent organizations ranging from massive to tiny, and come from all over the US and many other countries. Each year, we particularly welcome journalists and allies from the city hosting SRCCON, and we offer a slate of [remote-participation options](https://2017.srccon.org/transcription/) for those who can't attend in person.

## About Us

SRCCON is produced by [OpenNews](https://opennews.org). We connect a network of developers, designers, journalists and editors to collaborate on open technologies and processes within journalism. OpenNews believes that a community of peers working, learning and solving problems together can create a stronger, more responsive, and ascendant journalism ecosystem. Incubated at the [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/) from 2011-2016, OpenNews is now a project of [Community Partners](http://www.communitypartners.org/).

The “src” in SRCCON stands for “Source,” as in "view source." We pronounce it “Source-con,” but you can say it however you want.
