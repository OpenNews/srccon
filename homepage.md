## About SRCCON

 SRCCON, launched in 2014 in Philadelphia and <a href="/logistics">returning in 2015 in Minneapolis</a>, is produced by <a href="http://opennews.org">Knight-Mozilla OpenNews</a>, an organization built to support the community of news developers, designers, and data reporters helping journalism thrive on the open web. (The "src" in SRCCON stands for "<a href="http://source.opennews.org">Source</a>," and we pronounce it "Source-con," though you can say it however you want.)

 <a href="/sessions">Our sessions</a> focus on technical, design, editorial, and cultural topics within the news world, and we welcome participants from all fields who want to strengthen journalism online.
