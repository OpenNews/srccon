Tickets to SRCCON 2015 are now sold out.

## Volunteering
SRCCON volunteers help with registration, support session leaders, work on set-up and clean-up, and help us accomplish all the unexpected tasks that come up during an event. If you want to attend SRCCON and are excited about playing this type of vital support role, please [email us](srccon@opennews.org) for information about volunteering.

## Including the Community
As part of our wider diversity and inclusion efforts, we are working to make sure SRCCON tickets are available to people in smaller and non-coastal newsrooms, and to members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology. If you know someone who should be at SRCCON and might not know it, please [send them our way](srccon@opennews.org).
