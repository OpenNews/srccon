**The SRCCON 2016 ticket lottery is now closed**. Thanks to everyone who put their name in for the lottery this year.

**Here's what you need to know about getting a SRCCON ticket:**

* The lottery was open May 18 until noon Eastern on May 24. 
* Everyone who registered will be notified of their status in the lottery (selected or not) by **5pm Eastern on May 25**. 
* Each selected person will have 48 hours to buy a single, non-transferrable ticket. Tickets will cost $195.

## Welcome, first-timers

We think SRCCON is best when there's a mix of folks new to SRCCON and veterans of the conference. Our lottery system is designed to ensure that new SRCCON participants will get a healthy percentage of all available tickets, and will otherwise randomly allocate tickets. 

## Financial & family assistance

We offered a limited number of travel scholarships (now closed) to help people who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend, and we also offer attendees [free childcare](/childcare) run by providers we trust with our own kids.

## Sponsor tickets

If you're unable to get a ticket via the lottery and your organization is able to become a SRCCON sponsor, each level of sponsorship has tickets available, either as a part of the sponsorship package or held for reserved purchase. We offer a full rundown of available packages on [our sponsor page](/sponsors).
