## Cancellation and Transfers
SRCCON is a small event and we’re tuning the program to the exact attendee list we have, so please let us know as soon as you can if you’re not coming, because it may mean we’ll need to tweak our program a little. If you find that you’ll be unable to attend after all, you have two options: transfer your ticket to someone else (which is the quickest option), or get a refund (also fine but may take a little longer).

* You can transfer your SRCCON registration to someone else right up until June 24 with no charges or penalties. To switch the name on your ticket, just go back into your registration on Eventbrite and change the registration information to the new person. Or you can email the person’s name and contact information to  [srccon@opennews.org](mailto:srccon@opennews.org), and we’ll do the rest. (We can also help you find someone who needs a ticket—email us at [srccon@opennews.org](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) and we’ll get you fixed up.
* If you need to cancel, please contact us at source@opennews.org and let us know. You can cancel with no penalty up until two weeks before the conference begins (June 11). After July 11, we can’t refund your ticket, but you can still transfer it to someone else up until June 24, the day before SRCCON begins.


## Volunteering
SRCCON volunteers help with registration, support session leaders, work on set-up and clean-up, and help us accomplish all the unexpected tasks that come up during an event. If you want to attend SRCCON and are excited about playing this type of vital support role, please [email us](srccon@opennews.org) for information about volunteering.

## Including the Community
As part of our wider diversity and inclusion efforts, we are working to make sure SRCCON tickets are available to people in smaller and non-coastal newsrooms, and to members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology. If you know someone who should be at SRCCON and might not know it, please [send them our way](srccon@opennews.org).
