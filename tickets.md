Tickets to SRCCON 2017 will go on open sale at the beginning of May via a lottery. Similar to last year, when we switched to a lottery system, we believe that a conference as in-demand as SRCCON (prior to moving to a lottery, we were selling out in less than a minute) is better off with a system that isn't built around first-come-first-served.

So, once again, we'll be running a ticket lottery. Tickets will once again cost $195 and include admission to SRCCON, five meals, and access to our free childcare. **The lottery will open on May 3 and close on May 10.** Those selected in the lottery will be notified shortly thereafter.

Much more information about our ticket lottery will be forthcoming in the weeks preceeding the lottery open. In the meantime, feel free to read more about:

In addition to our ticket lottery, we have a number of other methods for attending SRCCON:

## Facilitating Sessions
In previous years, session facilitators have made up more than a third of all SRCCON attendees. All of our sessions are peer-led by conference attendees--not "experts" that only show up for their session. Consider becoming a facilitator at SRCCON this year by [learning more about sessions](/sessions). Our call for proposals opens March 22.

## Scholarships
Every year, thanks to sponsors, we offer scholarships to SRCCON. Scholarships include money for travel and a free ticket to the event. This year we'll have expanded scholarship offerings--more information is forthcoming.

## Sponsors
If your organization would like to help SRCCON happen, each level of sponsorship has tickets available, either as a part of the sponsorship package or for reserved purchase to sponsors. We will offer a full rundown of our available sponsor packages on our [sponsor page](/sponsors).
