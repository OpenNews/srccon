After last year's surprise three-minute sell-out, we expect tickets to sell very quickly, and we’re working on a sales process that is fair and transparent, and that takes time zones into consideration. Tickets will be available for sale on April 29, and cost $175.

As part of our wider diversity and inclusion efforts, we are also working to make sure SRCCON tickets are available to people in smaller and non-coastal newsrooms, and to members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology.

We're also [offering scholarships](/scholarships) to help defray the cost of participating in SRCCON. Applications are open now till April 24, and we'll notify applicants before tickets go on sale.

We'll post more information on the ticketing process in the coming weeks and months. In the meantime, please note that if you <a href="/sessions">pitch a session</a> we accept, you will be offered a chance to buy a ticket before the public on-sale date.
