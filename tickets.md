Tickets to SRCCON 2016 will go on open sale in May via lottery. This is a change from the way we've sold tickets previously—first-come/first-serve—because we we were selling out our entire ticket allocation in seconds. By switching to a lottery, we hope to offer a ticketing system that doesn't prioritize the speed of your internet connection or how fast you can mash a button.

**Here's what you need to know about getting a SRCCON ticket:**

* Tickets will cost $195.
* Registration for the lottery is open May 18 till noon Eastern on May 24.
* You will be notified of your status in the lottery (selected or not) by 5pm Eastern on May 25.
* If selected, you will have until 5pm Eastern on May 27 to buy your ticket.
* Each person selected will be able to buy one ticket.

You can [read lots more about our switch to a lottery system](LINK) on the OpenNews blog, and we'll post additional details when lottery registration opens on May 18.

## Welcome, n00bs

We think SRCCON is best when there's a mix of folks new to SRCCON and veterans of the conference. Our lottery system is designed to ensure that new SRCCON participants will get a healthy percentage of all available tickets, and will otherwise randomly allocate tickets. So SRCCON alums, you can put your name in without worrying that you're taking a new attendee's spot.

## Financial & family assistance

We offer a limited number of [travel scholarships](/scholarships) to help people who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend, and we also offer attendees [free childcare](/childcare) run by providers we trust with our own kids.

## Sponsor tickets

If you're unable to get a ticket via the lottery and your organization is able to become a SRCCON sponsor, each level of sponsorship has tickets available, either as a part of the sponsorship package or for reserved purchase to sponsors. We offer a full rundown of our available sponsor packages on [our sponsor page](/sponsors).
