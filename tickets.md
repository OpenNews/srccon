The SRCCON 2016 ticket lottery is now open for registration. This is our first year distributing tickets via lottery instead of a first-come/first-serve ticket sale, and we hope the switch to the lottery system will produce a smoother experience that doesn't favor the fastest internet connectionsâ€”or twitchiest clicking fingers.

**Here's what you need to know about getting a SRCCON ticket:**

* The lottery is open **May 18 until noon Eastern on May 24**.
* Tickets will cost $195, each person selected will be able to purchase a single ticket, and tickets are non-transferrable.
* You will be notified of your status in the lottery (selected or not) by 5pm Eastern on **May 25**. If selected, you will have 48 hours, until 5pm Eastern on May 27, to buy your ticket.

## Welcome, first-timers

We think SRCCON is best when there's a mix of folks new to SRCCON and veterans of the conference. Our lottery system is designed to ensure that new SRCCON participants will get a healthy percentage of all available tickets, and will otherwise randomly allocate tickets. So SRCCON alums, you can put your name in without worrying that you're taking a new attendee's spot.

## Financial & family assistance

We offer a limited number of [travel scholarships](/scholarships) to help people who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend, and we also offer attendees [free childcare](/childcare) run by providers we trust with our own kids.

## Sponsor tickets

If you're unable to get a ticket via the lottery and your organization is able to become a SRCCON sponsor, each level of sponsorship has tickets available, either as a part of the sponsorship package or held for reserved purchase. We offer a full rundown of available packages on [our sponsor page](/sponsors).
