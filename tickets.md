# Tickets

Tickets to SRCCON 2016 will go on open sale in May via a lottery. Here's what you need to know:

* Tickets will cost $195
* Registration for the lottery opens May 18 and closes at noon on May 24
* Each person will be able to register for one ticket. 

You can [read lots more about our switch to a lottery system]() on the OpenNews blog.

## Welcome, n00bs

Our lottery system is designed to ensure that new SRCCON participants will get a healthy percentage of all available tickets, and will otherwise randomly allocate tickets. So SRCCON alums, you can put your name in without worrying that you're taking a new attendee's spot. 

## Financial assistance 

Please note that we offer a limited number of [travel scholarships]() to help people who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend, and that we also offer [free, on-site childcare]() run by providers we trust with our own kids.

## Sponsor tickets

If you're unable to get a ticket via the lottery and your organization is willing to consider a sponsorship, here's the info to give them.
