# About SRCCON: Space to Connect

SRCCON (a contraction of "Source con") is a highly participatory and extraordinarily inclusive conference where participants come first so they can focus on collaborating on the work at hand. About 1/3 of attendees are also session facilitators who lead conversations and collaborative workshops focused on the practical challenges that news technology and data teams encounter every day. 

We welcome about 300 attendees, and everyone at SRCCON actively participates, whether they're facilitating a session, contributing to a conversation over lunch, or meeting new colleagues and supporting their work. The entire structure of the event is set up to allow participants to focus on getting to know each other and learning from the wisdom in the room, which means there are long breaks, group meals, and social events that create space for the life side of our work.

## How to Participate

We'll open a call for participation form in April to pitch a session, apply for a ticket, or tell us you'd like to participate in some other way. The session pitches create the entire SRCCON schedule, and the applications allow us to allocate tickets in an intentional way that equitably distributes attendance and ensures that there are a mix of perspectives and skills at the event. Our call for participation form helps us understand who would like to take part in SRCCON and what you want to get out of it.

## Things You Can Do At SRCCON

* **Facilitate a session.** All our sessions are peer-led by conference attendees. Facilitators share their experience (and their questions!) as they guide in-depth conversations, design exercises, demos, and workshops. You can [check out the schedule from 2018](https://2018.srccon.org/schedule/#_show-all) to get a sense of past sessions.
* **Gather a lunch conversation.** We want our program to respond to new topics as well, so we leave room for emergent conversations. If there's something on your mind that's not on our schedule, you can use our signup board at SRCCON to choose a space, grab a meal, and explore those ideas with other attendees.
* **Lead an evening hobby workshop.** Our evening program is a chance to show off your passion projects or even your quirkiest hobbies. We open up rooms for attendees to teach each other how to do fun stuff, and previous hobby workshops have covered everything from knitting to breakdancing, from powerlifting to popping ollies on a skateboard. You'll have a chance to share ideas for Thursday night as we get closer to SRCCON, so keep an eye on your attendee emails.
* **Check out Minneapolis.** If you’re looking for things to before, after, or during SRCCON, a group of local news nerds have compiled [this guide to wonderful things in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area](/local-guide).
* **Organize activities during SRCCON.** If you spot something interesting in the local guide (or maybe you're packing some ideas of your own), we have a signup board at SRCCON to make it easy to gather a group, get out, and have a great time. Attendees have used our activity boards to set up things like outings to concerts and baseball games, brewery tours, and restaurant visits for karaoke.
* **Organize events around SRCCON.** We also can't wait to see what you want to work on with everyone else in town! The days before and after SRCCON can be a great time to pull together an open hack day or meetup, or work with remote colleagues you don't often see in person. We can help you get the word out, especially if you jump on that kind of planning early enough for people to account for it in their travel arrangements.

## Things To Help Everyone Participate

* **Meals (and snacks) at SRCCON.** It's easier to get the most out of an event when you don't have to wonder when you'll get a chance to eat. We provide some meals on both conference days, including a delicious dinner Thursday night. We’ll also have tea, coffee, and plenty of snacks—healthy and sugary, both—throughout the day.
* **Every attendee is a peer.** Our conference badges don’t flag organizations or speaker status—we’re all here to learn from each other.
* **Space set aside for work.** We hope you'll be able to fully engage with the community at SRCCON, but we know that deadlines and projects back home don't magically disappear when you get to Minneapolis. If you need to get a few things done, we have some open work space in the venue.
* **Financial assistance.** We offer a limited number of [travel scholarships](/scholarships) to help people who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend. 
* **Live transcription.** We work with [White Coat Captioning](http://www.whitecoatcaptioning.com/) to provide live transcription of a portion of SRCCON sessions and all group talks.
* **An accessible venue, and space for quiet and nursing.** Our venue is [transit accessible](https://mac-events.org/directions/index.html) and the entire building is ADA compliant with accessible and single-use restrooms. We also have a quiet room and space for nursing parents.
* **Childcare.** We offer childcare support throughout SRCCON, and have worked with the provider [KiddieCorp](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/) for the last several years.
* **Local support groups.** We want to make sure people are aware of nearby meetings that can be helpful. If there's a group you'd like to see listed here, [please let us know](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).
    * **Alcoholics Anonymous.** On Thursday night, the closest meeting to SRCCON is at Drinkytown AA, [University Lutheran Church of Hope 601 13th Av SE](https://www.google.com/maps/place/University+Lutheran+Church+of+Hope/@44.983557,-93.235761,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x7e2b9cb466a3fbda?sa=X&ei=4jiEVZyHMcbgoASy45voCQ&ved=0CG8Q_BIwCg), which meets Thursday at 6:30pm. It is an “open” meeting, meaning that you don’t have to be alcoholic to go. AA Minneapolis also hosts [a full list of area meetings](https://aaminneapolis.org/meetings/?tsml-day=4&tsml-region=1388).
