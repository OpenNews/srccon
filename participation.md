# Participation at SRCCON

SRCCON is a hands-on conference, which means that everyone who attends actively participates throughout the event. Our [call for participation form](/participation/form/) is open till April 24, and it's where you tell us about what you'd like to share, whether that be as a facilitator or attendee, and what you hope to take back home with you. We also wrote a question-by-question [walkthrough of the call for participation form itself](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon2019-participation-howto/) to help you tell us all about how you'd like to join us at SRCCON.

We keep the size of SRCCON intentionally rather small at 300 people, and we've experimented with different ways to allocate tickets. We've landed on this approach—one single form to gather session ideas, applications to attend, and scholarship requests—as the easiest experience for potential attendees and a streamlined process for us in organizing the conference, too.

The small conference size means that we have to be intentional about equitably distributing tickets and ensuring that there's a mix of perspectives and skills at SRCCON. Our [call for participation form](/participation/form/) will help us understand who would like to take part in SRCCON and what you want to get out of it. With those responses, we're able to create a schedule and audience that reflects the dynamic interests and needs of this community.

The form is open from April 10-24. After that, we will review entries and notify everyone by May 10. If invited to attend, you will have the chance to purchase a ticket, with [prices starting at $225 plus fees](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon-2019-launch).

## A New Approach to Ticket Prices

This year [we're experimenting with a tiered ticket pricing system](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon-2019-launch). Accessibility remains a core value for us, and this is our attempt to balance the actual costs of the conference with keeping prices as manageable for attendees as possible. We also continue to offer [scholarships to attend](/scholarships).

Here are the tiers (plus Eventbrite ticketing fees):

* **$225:** This was our ticket price last year and remains the base price for people who are paying their own way, from small news organizations with fewer than 50 people, or nonprofits with budgets $750,000 or less.
* **$375:** A new ticket price for people from medium-sized news organizations of 51-250 employees, nonprofits with budgets $750,000-$2 million, and other similar-sized organizations.
* **$695:** This ticket tier reflects very nearly the actual cost for each attendee of SRCCON and is for people from large news organizations with more than 250 employees, nonprofits with budgets over $2 million, and other organizations that provide full professional-development budgets for employees.

These tiers will be shared on an honor system. We’ll ask attendees to register for their ticket by picking the tier that best reflects their situation, with the descriptions as guidelines not requirements. This system is not meant to imply people should feel obligated to pay a higher price. It's our attempt at responding to community feedback encouraging us to find ways to share event costs.
 
These ticket sales are part of what enables us to organize an event with 40 event scholarships, free childcare, live transcription, two lunches, dinner, and ample snacks and drinks, and the support of a skilled event team in preparing sessions and constructing a schedule that lets attendees focus on learning and talking together. 

## Not Just Attendees, But Participants

At SRCCON, everyone participates in some way. [Our hands-on sessions rely on participants](/program) who are ready to share their experiences and perspectives. Check out [the proposals we've received for this year's program so far](/sessions/proposals/).

Facilitators create space for in-depth conversations, design exercises, demos, and workshops, and participants bring questions and take ideas back to their newsrooms. In addition to sessions, folks help make SRCCON an inclusive, welcoming place by leading fun group activities like knitting or book clubs, volunteering, and saying hi to new potential friends and collaborators over meals and coffee/tea/hot beverages.

We'll have a few questions for you about what you'd like to bring to SRCCON and what you're hoping to take home with you. We look forward to seeing what ideas folks have and how we can make them possible during our two days together.

## Welcome, First-timers

We think SRCCON is best when there's a mix of folks new to SRCCON and veterans of the conference. And we want new folks to feel able to participate in whatever ways interest you. There's a spot [on the form](/participation/form/) to ask for more information if you're interested in attending but not quite sure how you want to participate. In reviewing forms, we'll aim to have a healthy balance of newcomers and returning SRCCON participants. So SRCCON alums, you can put your name in without worrying that you're taking a new attendee's spot.

## Financial & Family Assistance

We offered a limited number of [travel scholarships](/scholarships) to help people who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend. To apply for a scholarship to SRCCON, just let us know on the [call for participation form](/participation/form/).

In addition to financial assistance, we know that making sure you have coverage for your children is important, so we also offer attendees [free childcare](/childcare) run by providers we trust with our own kids. There's a question on the form to let us know you'd like more information about childcare.
