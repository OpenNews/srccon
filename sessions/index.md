The SRCCON program will be built around facilitated sessions in which participants hold conversations and workshops about code, data, security, interactive design, and other topics of interest to people who code in news organizations.

Sessions will be set up to maximize small-group collaboration, with an eye toward continuing work and conversations through SRCCON and after. [We expect themes will develop across sessions and are eager to support connections between groups, so please let us know if there's someone who should be involved in SRCCON who we may not already know.]

Similar/alt approach to the inclusion question, to go somewhere on this or another page: We also have a community-wide request: if you know someone who loves to code and is interested in journalism and related work and you think they might enjoy SRCCON, please take a moment to send them to our site or [make an introduction](email link), especially if you think they might not hear about it otherwise. [SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING]

###You Should Pitch
Anyone can lead a session, and we encourage you to pitch an idea (or two or three) if you're planning to attend. Great sessions often start out with a relatively simple question or problem. If you've been struggling with or mulling something, you can bet other folks have dealt with that too. You won't need pre-prepared slides, just the willingness to lead an engaged conversation or workshop about a topic of interest to journo-coders.

New to the scene or have an idea but aren't sure if you're up to leading a session? Go ahead and pitch—we're happy to do leader-prep for anyone who wants to lead a session, and we can probably also match you up with a co-leader who can help keep your nerves under control.

###How a Pitch Becomes a Session
Session pitches close on Monday, June 9, and we take five days to sort through everything and assemble a well-balanced conference program. If you've pitched a session, we'll email you starting on Friday, June 13 to let you know whether or not your session made it into the program—and if it didn't, you'll still be welcome to bring it to SRCCON and put it into the running for one of the session places we're keeping open until the event begins. We expect to publish the list of planned sessions on Friday, June 20.

**Important**: All SRCCON participants, _including session leaders_, will need to buy a ticket, so if you want to come to the conference, don't wait to see if your pitch is accepted—go ahead and grab a ticket when they open, because we expect them to sell out reasonably quickly.
