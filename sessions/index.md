title: Pitch Your Session
---
The SRCCON program will be built around facilitated sessions in which participants hold conversations and workshops about code, data, security, interactive design, and other topics of interest to people who code in news organizations.

Sessions will be set up to maximize small-group collaboration, with an eye toward continuing work and conversations through SRCCON and after. [We expect themes will develop across sessions and are eager to support connections between groups, so please let us know if there's someone who should be involved in SRCCON who we may not already know.]

Similar/alt approach to the inclusion question, to go somewhere on this or another page: We also have a community-wide request: if you know someone who loves to code and is interested in journalism and related work and you think they might enjoy SRCCON, please take a moment to send them to our site or [make an introduction](email link), especially if you think they might not hear about it otherwise. [SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING]
