<p class="bodybig">The SRCCON program will be built around facilitated sessions in which participants hold conversations and workshops about code, data, security, interactive design, and other topics of interest to people who code in news organizations. Thank you to everyone who <a href="/sessions/proposals">proposed a session</a>. The call for proposals is now closed.</p>

### What to expect at SRCCON

SRCCON will be built around two days of small-group conversations and hands-on workshops that run for an hour or two and a half hours. Check out the [list of proposed sessions](/sessions/proposals) to get a sense of the range of topics and angles you can expect to see on the final sessions list.

We&rsquo;ll also be hosting a series of informal evening talks on non-work topics, opening up space for small-group collaboration, and running a hands-on coffee-hacking station. The event takes place in a [walking-friendly area](/logistics/), so during the spaces between sessions and group meals, there will also be plenty of opportunities to get out and enjoy Philadelphia&rsquo;s Old City with friends and colleagues.

### What happens next

The OpenNews team is currently evaluating proposals and building the list of accepted SRCCON sessions. We&rsquo;ll notify accepted session leaders beginning June 13 and publish the session list June 19, and we&rsquo;ll also leave a few session slots open for ideas that develop live at SRCCON.

*Reminder:* All SRCCON participants, including session leaders, need a ticket to the event. If you have a session accepted, you will have an opportunity to purchase a ticket for one session leader per accepted session.
