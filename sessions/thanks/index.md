Thank you for submitting a proposal to SRCCON. If you like, you could submit another proposal. If you're all set, please consider inviting your friends to submit a proposal and join us in Philadelphia July 24-25. In particular, please help us spread the word to people who we may not already know.

Reminder: SRCCON tickets go on sale May 30 and we expect them to sell out quickly. Everyone, including session leaders, must buy a ticket.
