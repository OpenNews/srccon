Thank you for submitting a proposal to SRCCON. If you like, you can [submit another proposal](/sessions/pitch). If you&rsquo;re all set, please consider inviting your friends to submit a proposal and join us in Philadelphia July  24-25. In particular, please help us spread the word to people who we may not already know about the event.

Reminder: All SRCCON participants, including session leaders, need a ticket to the event. We sold out much sooner than we expected to, and although we are working on increasing capacity, we can't guarantee that if you submit a proposal, we can open a ticket for you. If you **do** have a ticket and just pitched a session though, right on!
