<p class="bodybig">Loosely speaking, our program will be made of facilitated conversations and workshops focused on code, data, security, interactive design, and related topics with relevance to newsrooms. But most importantly, we want to know what you want to talk about and work on at SRCCON.</p>

Your proposals will be published on the SRCCON site (private fields excepted), and the selected sessions will be used to craft the schedule for the two-day conference. OpenNews staff will be available throughout the proposal process, during the run-up to the event, and all through the conference if you have any questions about your session idea or would like support in leading a great session.

**Important:** All SRCCON participants, **including session leaders**, need a ticket to the event. If you have a session accepted, you will have an opportunity to purchase a ticket for **one session leader per accepted session**. If you already have a ticket and haven&rsquo;t yet pitched a session, please consider doing so! 

So tell us, what&rsquo;s your perfect SRCCON session?
