<p class="bodybig">We want to know what you want to talk about during SRCCON. The SRCCON program will be built around facilitated sessions in which participants hold conversations and workshops about code, data, security, interactive design, and other topics of interest to people who code in news organizations.</p>
These proposals will be published publicly on the SRCCON site and the selected sessions will be used to craft the schedule for the two-day conference. OpenNews staff will be available throughout the proposal process, planning, and during the event if you have any questions about your session idea or would like support in facilitating a session.

So, what would you like to chat about?
