Then, we will present EXTRA (“EXTraction Rules Apparatus”), an open source project that was developed by IPTC (https://iptc.org) with the support of Google DNI and allows news editors to precisely identify the categories to which a piece of news belongs to. The system manages to recommend the most relevant categories using Boolean rules, with sophisticated natural language processing capabilities. We particularly look for the audience to share their views and experience on news tags and taxonomies, what problems they have had or know of and ways they could be solved. Then we will show how this new open source tool can help editors in newsrooms build their own taxonomy system and will let the participants interact with the system and try building their own rules to categorize news stories.",

Each category has four questions and you will get 1, 3, 5, or 7 points to wager on each question. The questions will be based off user research and academic studies about how people consume news. \n\nRound Two: Pictures. We will have screenshots of A/B tests from apps and websites of real publications. Players will need to guess which screenshot was the winning one. \n\nRound Three: Numbers. We will ask questions about the percentage of online users that engage in certain habits. The team that guesses the closest correct percentage wins the points. \n\nFinal Round: Guess the pub! We will read five clues (audience characteristics) of each publication. The earlier you guess the publication, the more points you get – but be careful, if you guess incorrectly you'll get 0 points! \n\nThe winning team will get something totally amazing, like tickets to Hamilton or a puppy. This pub quiz is a great way to have some fun, get to know other attendees, and learn something about the people who consume the content we create.

Yet in many newsrooms, we miss this opportunity and only engage our audiences post-publication. Often, we think of user research as something used exclusively for developing technology platforms. But it’s applicable to all kinds of newsroom workflows, from editorial to design to engagement to business development. Creating processes to learn and improve user experiences (UX) can lead to more inclusive digital platforms, content, and tools that share information and engage audiences. \n\nWhen is user feedback valuable? Pretty much always: during the ideation, creation or validation phases for content, platforms, tools and experiences. However, at each of these stages, how and why we use audience feedback is subtly different. So, to navigate this process, we will work together to draw a project roadmap that outlines what types of user feedback can be collected at each stage, and what methods are most appropriate. We’ll identify and practice some impactful ways to gather and respond to user feedback. We will also brainstorm audience engagement tactics, such as: usability testing of interactive graphics on mobile devices, focus groups to decide next steps after a story is produced, or co-designing processes for audiences to engage with your organization in new ways.",

Content format compatibility issues, maintaining wholly separate designs inside of early-stage platforms with low feature-sets, participation being equally opt-in and required to maintain SEO and reach, reduced ad opportunities, and gaps in analytics...it was a lot to take in. But publishers are doing more than making the best of it: they’re thriving.\n\nIn this session, we’ll look at what we’ve learned from learning to adapt.

The label read: “put finger in hole.”\n\nFluxus artists were playful revolutionaries who tried to undermine the authority of the museum, and the primacy of the artist, often by requiring the viewer to the complete (and, in doing so, co-create) a piece of art.  To many of us, interactive has become a noun.  But how interactive is your interactive, really?  When’s the last time you stopped to consider just how revolutionary an idea it is to include your reader in the completion (or co-creation) of your work as a journalist?\n\nIn this session, we will disengage from our newsrooms and our tools and our data sets for a while and think about the essence of interaction.  What entices us to reach beyond ourselves and affect the world?  What do we expect?  What makes those experiences rewarding?  Is there a difference between exploration and interaction?  How does individual action differ from communal participation?\n\nAlong the way, we’ll consider a range of contrived, non-journalistic, interactive experiences: religious services, Fluxus happenings, game nights, and dance parties.  And we’ll ask why some experiences that invite interaction meet with indifference or refusal.\n\nFinally, we will take our inspiration and create instructions for building a digital interactive experience, and exchange them with each other.  Take your instructions home.  Follow them.  After SRCCON, we’ll publish all the interactives together as new sNerdFluxkit (2017).",

Not very many great resources exist, testing can be a pain, and just figuring out where to start can leave you scratching your head. Thinking about it in the context of journalism and visual storytelling — where content is dominant and often unpredictable — can be even more confusing. As a result, if accessibility gets thought about at all, it’s often an afterthought. If you’re someone who needs an accessible site, you’re left wandering in an information wasteland.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way! Building accessible content and interfaces — even on tight deadlines — is completely doable. You just have to think about it from the beginning. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of basic accessibility principles, tools, and testing. We’ll then break into groups and look at those principles in the context of journalism — testing some apps, looking at alt text, debating the pros and cons of delivering alternative experiences and and dissecting data visualizations and sites in a way that will help you think about how usable the site really is. You’ll walk away with a sheaf of resources, practical tips to improve your next project and, hopefully, a new understanding of what accessibility on the web can look like.",

They write stories, take photos, record audio, shoot video, manage a website and interact with the audience on social media. They’re dedicated to their mission of finding and sharing news, but they face challenges: it’s difficult to recruit media professionals to rural areas; burnout is common; and many news organizations lack the knowledge and training necessary to incorporate new technology. Nonetheless, they push forward. Some are trying new storytelling methods, learning new technology and developing innovative ways to reach and grow their audience. They are small, but mighty. And with a little help, they could be mightier. Let’s have a conversation about the challenges small, rural organizations face, and then brainstorm the best ways to help them. Maybe that’s through new technology, or training that’s accessible to them where they work. It may be as simple as a virtual support network that ties small newsrooms together so they can encourage each other and share best practices. As these rural news operations grow stronger and become more digital, they’ll be able to share their stories with a wider audience. That will benefit the individual organizations, but it will also help the wider audience - the cities and the coasts - see a more complete picture of the country.",

Then, we’ll divide into groups and come up with any and all relevant metaphors (if time allows, we’ll even do a GIF-based brainstorm!) We’ll eventually refine and narrow down a list of useful metaphors — and none of that “explain what you do to your mom” language — the outcome of this session will be accessible and inclusive metaphors for all!",

Being part of the union organizing committee we dealt with the challenges of unionizing. Given that we're in an era where the journalism community is under persistent attack from the Trump regime, we want more newsrooms to unionize across the country. \n\nIn this session we want to have a broader discussion about unionizing, focusing on the pros and cons and the process of joining a union.",

        "description": "News is competitive. Digital news, even more so. And when we're all playing in the same space of news feeds and closed captioning, text must find a way to captivate an audience. But manipulating typography has been an age-old trick of tabloid magazines and sensationalized journalism, so why have we allowed some of these tactics to leak into the realm of digital journalism? Intentional or not, our use and abuse of typography brings up everything from silly snafus, like announcing the wrong winner of Miss Universe, to deeply unethical content that can stir fear and manipulate an audience's point of view. Let's explore how we may be using and abusing type in our newsrooms, how to avoid unethical treatment of typography, and what we can do to leverage text to our advantage *and* our audience's advantage.",
