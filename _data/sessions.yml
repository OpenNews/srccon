Our community is reflecting on recent years of our work and has established design patterns and philosophies. But we mostly talk about how we do our journalism -- now let’s talk about the people doing it. How have the expectations of a journalist’s career trajectory changed with emerging roles and disciplines? Have we made our corner of the industry open to aspiring news nerds who might not have access to the tools and resources that gave many of us a lift into this field? And what if you don’t see your job as your calling? Our goal is provide a catharsis about our work and develop solutions that look out for the people doing this work. We’ll ask hard questions of ourselves to foster a discussion about the sustainability of what we do."

But what exactly is audience development? How do you find these magical creatures? What do they do? And can they really help connect your journalism with more people? The simple answer is yes. If you do it right. FRONTLINE has had an audience development team for four years, and it has been transformative. We’ve learned that when our editorial and audience teams work side by side, hand in hand we CAN make magic together. We've seen double and triple digit growth across multiple platforms. But the process isn’t always easy, pretty or comfortable. In this session we’ll have an open and honest conversation about our lessons learned. We’ll share stories of success and failures. And we’ll offer practical advice and tips for people who work in traditional newsrooms -- and for traditional bosses uncomfortable with thinking about audience. We’d also open it up to the room to hear more about how other newsrooms are approaching this."

Nobody meant to cause Meyer harm, but thoughtlessness in the design of the feature (what he termed \"inadvertent algorithmic cruelty\") still left him shaken. And countless other examples abound. Of course, in the news industry, we're no strangers to accidental (and disastrous) juxtaposition: real estate ads placed next to stories on homelessness, bots that generate cringe-worthy content, and scheduled social media posts that go out during the worst kind of breaking news. In this session, we'll look at case studies of humane and inhumane design, practice identifying pitfalls in our news apps, and figure out how to care for our readers beyond just transmitting information."

        "description": "Usually, collaboration, especially in a small newsroom, looks a bit like this: Person A slogs in the trenches solo, cleans data, analyzes, comes up with an insight, writes a draft, sends to Person B. Person B realizes Person A likely made an error in the cleaning, tears apart draft, comes up with new insight. Person A goes back to square one, finds their error, redoes everything and sends it back. Person B questions their own judgement and sends the draft to Person C. Person C finds more errors Person B noticed but decided not to raise considering the hell they’d already put Person A through. Newsroom dissolves in a panic as Persons A, B and C all realize that this is going in next month’s issue so they’d better find, fix and spruce up these errors and fast. In a slightly better world, Person A notices their error, asks Person B for help, Person B drops everything they’re doing, helps find the error in 100 lines of code and correct it, tries to explain what they did, and then, if they’re lucky, return to the work they were doing before. But again, newsroom panic is likely. We think pair programming might be a way to short-circuit this cycle of agony and provide ways for small clusters of reporters to work together more effectively. For example, if Person A and Person B worked in tandem instead on projects like data cleaning, but also like writing, audio editing and page-designing, and helped catch errors early. That saves time and energy. We also think it could be a way to help build reusable skills in micro-newsrooms where multipurpose projects are a necessity. So instead of Person B simply correcting the error, they can correct the error in tandem with Person A so Person A can now fix that problem for themselves. We don’t know for sure this will work but we want to try to out different models of collaboration. In essence, we’d like to run an experiment on a group of SRCCON attendees: Can pair programming and other forms of collaboration drawn from outside the journalism field help resolve some of our own intractable problems? Here’s what we imagine the session looking like: Intro discussion on what pair programming is, why people do it, what makes pairing different from other forms of collaboration (10 min) Pairing activity - Attendees will split into pairs, pick a non-programming task (analyzing a data set, writing a script, editing audio, etc.) and use pair programming techniques to complete that task (25 min) Groups share their experiences (5 min) Discussion - What other types of process from programming can we adopt in the newsroom? (10 min)"

It is frequently the case that data from our digital footprints is used to predict our behavior and make decisions about the choices available to us. This unprecedented capacity to collect and analyze data has brought along with it a troubling dismissiveness of user agency, participation, and ownership. Such systems assume that it is an acceptable by-product for their users to have no understanding of the decisions being made about them and no agency in that decision-making process. For the most part, the invisibilized nature of these decisions are seen as a feature, not a bug, of a good user experience. As we begin to use algorithmic decision-making in areas of our lives that are increasingly high-stakes, it is essential that we create and utilize processes that maintain user agency and understanding. In this session, participants will be imagining and designing user experiences that employ participatory algorithmic-decision making processes. The session will be open to folks from all experience levels. We would be excited to see folks from a variety of different backgrounds, including designers, data scientists, journalists, privacy & security practitioners, and organizers from marginalized and frequently surveilled communities."

As the tools we use for storytelling become not just more diverse but more constrained by the spectre of Terms Of Service, can we hedge our bets? Or to put it a different way, does our work to serve both third-party platforms and the websites that serve as our foundations actually constitute a zero-sum game? This session proposes that, by stepping back, we can imagine a workflow and toolset that serves both needs—and, by extension, newsrooms—even better than the current generation of content management systems. In order to investigate this approach, we will ask three questions: 1. Rather than abandon the benefits that the web affords us as a structure, how can we carry with us the ethos and process of the web as we negotiate these new platforms? 2. Can our industry call upon a history of standards and protocols to avoid partner lock-in? 3. Should our tools pivot from a focus on authorship to one of reportage and remixing, allowing us to use new platforms in focused ways without losing control over the source material? What if the web is the best idea? How can we retain the imperatives of the web as we serve the future of storytelling, and what are the kinds of tools and standards we can rally around to preserve that context while allowing us to experiment in other people's walled gardens?"

This creates a twofold problem: fans can't highlight, comment on, or share parts of their favorite podcast, and potential new listeners can't discover shows through those clips and highlights. In this session, we'll explore the idea of what \"giffable audio\" might be. We'll discuss what forms of expression we can support through giffable audio, what unique and interesting affordances audio (and more specifically, podcasts) might have, and how we can design tools that can create this new kind of audio culture on social media.

        "description": "“A new form of journalism.” That’s what George Gallup said that asking people about their preferences equates to—and that was back in the 1930s (“Politics and the New Machine,” The New Yorker, November 16, 2015). The goal of listening to audiences isn’t a new one and is highly valuable for producing powerful news presentations. Yet many media organizations aren’t utilizing user research today because of lack of funds, recording equipment, physical space and/or expert guidance. In lacking easy ways to gain insights into people's busy lives, news teams can become overly dependent on their own instincts. This results in unimaginative story presentations and tired templates that fail to engage existing and would­-be audiences. It doesn’t have to be this way. Let’s discuss and sketch what a user research toolkit for distributed news teams might look like. What combination of methods for listening and observation (including but not limited to interviews, surveys, usability testing and co-­design techniques) would help your own team’s efforts? How can we best enable people working across functions to run their own audience research? What would it take for newsrooms to adopt a more flexible take on the traditional usability lab? This session will involve a lot of creativity as well as real talk about organizational change and costs considerations. Come join as we democratize user experience research access to make improvements for reader, viewer and listener benefit."

News organizations could be taking better advantage of what mobile devices track, delivering better news experiences by taking into account time of day and a user’s location and personal preferences. But how much information are users willing to give up about themselves? And where should we draw the line between offering valuable experiences and being overly invasive? This workshop will prompt thinking about questions around privacy and mobile use, casting participants in the role of users (which we all are, anyway) and asking them to consider: What personal information would you be willing to give up for the sake of a news-focused digital service, and why? We’ll discuss the range of permissions that mobile developers have access to, and debate when and how they might be used to deliver better experiences. At the end the session we’ll have considered as a group the ways users may want to limit the personal data they share, and also what kinds of convenience or customization in news experiences on mobile would make the exchange of personal information more palatable."

Maybe it's best to admit defeat and scale back our features, producing more static, less interactive content. Or should we fight against our limits and find ways to make our features work everywhere? Most importantly, how do we communicate our decision-making process to others and establish reasonable expectations in the newsroom? In this session we'll break into groups and play with some big desktop-centric interactives. We'll identify what features might prevent it from working on all platforms, and how they might be redesigned or optimized under the hood for maximum compatibility."

The NYTimes, Guardian, Washington Post, Galena Gazette, and more have several centuries worth of content between them. However it's fair to say that 90% of daily traffic goes directly against stories published in the last week. Archive stories can hold a rich and unique mirror to the events of today, but face a number of challenges in being found and resurfaced: organization, classification, relevancy. Resurfacing content from even moderately sized archives is a challenge: often, it’s as much art as science. It is almost a brute force exercise to determine quality and notability. Yet we know there is a meaningful history and legacy buried there. How do we make sense of the present when we cannot easily access the past? Why is this hard? We often think in historical terms over decades - and rarely in the smaller events that define our day to day. Staff across many departments may not have the necessary depth of knowledge about the archives to know where to draw from, and institutional knowledge is lost between generations. Metadata and taxonomy may not be established to help classify and surface. Tooling may not exist or may be inaccessible to guide making intelligent suggestions. In this talk, we’ll explore working with your archives by talking about how we work with ours. Low-hanging fruit to bring gems to the surface, long-term strategies to make archives more accessible, and to ensure that today's content is accessible tomorrow."

In this session, let's discuss successful and not so successful examples of \"too much data\", think about when is it time to give up the desire of \"show them all\", how to trim down information effectively to create a truly enjoyable experience for readers, and hopefully come up with a draft of guidelines for future practices."

In the newsroom developer community, that number has got to be even tinier. How do we get developers into the smaller metropolitan newsrooms that need them? How do we reorganize and reinvent this segment of our news ecosystem that is least equipped to hire and experiment with new products and platforms? As our field evolves and matures, it's worth examining why our jobs continue to gravitate to big-money coastal newsrooms, what it means for local news to be left out of the renaissance, and how we might endeavor to change it."

Millie and SMI spent the last year thinking about what makes a news app sound like a smart interesting friend. In this session we’ll workshop how to ensure your news bots don't get stuck in a boring valley of uncanny."

        "description": "The formula seems simple: something happens and we report on it. The faster the better, so long as we follow standards. But the pace accelerated quickly – print and hourly news segments seems antiquated compared to the internet, where a tweet from a source is seconds away from being pushed, klaxon'd and marquee'd worldwide. Editors need ever-evolving tools & guidelines that enable quick publishing on their own platforms and social/distribution channels. Newsroom nerds need to build stable and iterable tools so editors can keep tabs on their report, audience and competition. Readers, on the other hand, expect the news to find them like magic — mobile-first, device-friendly, geo-fenced, natively rendered (AMP, Facebook, iOS), media-rich AND omnisciently relevant to their specific interests.\n\n* How do we balance all those moving parts?\n* How do we reach people who define relevant breaking news for themselves?\n* How do we answer different-paced audiences — news-junkies vs. news-curious vs. late-comers?\n* How do we adjust when features that seem great one moment are clichéd the next?\n\nThis conversation will look inside two newsrooms: the New York Times (storied, weighty, born of a print legacy) and Breaking News (younger, nimble and born of Twitter) for what lessons each can each share."

It's easy to talk about the technical challenges of creating and maintaining these apps, and it's easy to argue for their existence in favor of openness — but what about the ethical challenges? There is much we've collectively learned over the course of nearly six years of maintaining the Texas Tribune's salary and prisoner databases. No matter how prepared you may be for the inevitable requests for exclusion, eventually there will be a request that causes you to pause and ask, \"wait, are we doing this right?\" What do you do when your established protocol is woefully inadequate for a person's request? When your news app puts you or your organization in the position of power, how do you ensure the humans in the data are treated with empathy? Our goal with this session is to encourage a dialog on and around these issues. We will go over our current policies, and share stories of what we've done well... and what we've done not so well. We'll work through different scenarios together, discuss and debate our responses and provide a space to discuss real life examples."

Let’s share examples of publishers making the most of this new creative format which demands a different story-telling style, combining text, animation and video. Optimising for this silent format is also a great reason to make your videos accessible through subtitles or closed-captions. Whether you’re already captioning your videos or looking to get started let’s go through recently developed tools for making this easier including crowdsourcing (Amara) and Speech To Text (Trint) and how you can integrate them into your workflows publishing on YouTube and Facebook."
