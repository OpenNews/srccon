The census is making headlines because several states are suing the Trump administration over its plans to include a citizenship question. But much of the news glosses over why the census is important and how it affects everyone’s lives. Congressional representation is at stake, along with $800 billion in federal funds that will get disbursed for state, county, and community programs over the next decade.\n\nWhen KPCC conducted human-centered design research into the census and the opportunities for public service journalism, one finding stood out: We can’t assume educated news consumers know the stakes or the mechanics of the census. There was a very low level of census knowledge among the people we interviewed, including current NPR listeners. How can we address this knowledge gap? We have some ideas. Let's talk.",

For the first time in decades, the mayor's office was up for grabs with no incumbent and no heir apparent to the 5th floor of City Hall. Meanwhile, the clerk, treasurer and entire 50-seat City Council were up for election. Competition was fierce.\n\nSmall newsrooms faced the daunting task of covering all of these races. More than 200 candidates were running for local office -- including more than a dozen for mayor -- from complete unknowns to career pols. All of this was taking place in a news environment where media often struggles to engage voters and help them make informed decisions.\n\nWith these challenges in mind, a group of five local independent newsrooms decided to pool their resources and work together to create a one-stop resource to serve voters. In a matter of days, the Chi.vote Collaborative was founded, launching a website with candidate profiles, articles, voter resources and other information. The collaborative grew to 10 partners and traffic to the website surged heading into the February election and eventual April runoff. We literally built the car as we drove it, rolling out new features as fast as we could develop them. All while publishing new stories and information daily. \n\nWe quickly learned a lot about collaborating, building on each other's strengths and overcoming challenges. Here are our takeaways, what worked and what didn't, along with tips, insights and all the key technical details that could help you and your collaborators cover the next election.",

It's a part of our journalistic economy, as the money and power in journalism is focused in just a few geographic locations--but it can also be damaging to local communities, and it can lead to misrepresentation, distrust and resentment. Often, national journalists appear in a community in times of trauma and elections, and report stories with insufficient context, while local journalists struggle to access equivalent resources for necessary ongoing reporting. This session will explore our collective experiences with parachute journalism as both insiders and outsiders to a community, in order to produce good ideas about how to do harm reduction, increase accountability, and shift power dynamics. We'll ask: Are there situations where it's better if this story just doesn't get told? How do we evaluate that? What can national media outlets and freelancers do to connect and collaborate with local journalists and local communities? What are the ethics of accountable partnerships? In what ways do local and regional/national media needs differ, and how can journalists collaborate to produce stories that better address the needs of all involved? All of this will be driving at a larger question: What does justice and accountability look like in the practice of journalism?",

We not only generated unique data, but also stories and context we never would have heard if we hadn’t met people where they lived. \n\nMore and more, journalists are experimenting with community engagement practices to accurately reflect and represent people’s lived experiences. We can do the same by taking an analog approach to creating data, including our community in the stories we tell about them. This helps verify the data by collecting it ourselves and having subject matter experts (your community!) vet it along the way. It also makes our reporting process more transparent and creates a group of people invested in our work. \n\nWe’ll share what we did and what we learned in our neighborhood mapping experiments, and invite a discussion on other ways to weave community engagement into data reporting.
