        "description": "Ignoring anything related to ads is a point of pride for a lot of newsroom developers. But there’s a major shift coming in how ads are sold, served, and measured, and it has huge implications for how news websites will be designed and built. If you work on a site that has ads, you should be getting ready for viewability.\n\nMost ads are sold at a price per thousand impressions, and traditionally impressions are counted as soon as the ad is inserted into the page. But the “viewable impression” is counted only after the ad enters the browser’s viewport. For some sites, this means that HALF of all ads served might never be seen by a reader or paid for by an advertiser.\n\nThis session will provide an overview of online advertising in general, and ad viewability in particular. I'll cover the technologies used to measure viewability and how it might impact the design and development of news sites. Finally, I’ll provide some ideas for how newsroom developers can adapt to viewability, use it to their advantage, and even borrow some concepts to improve the news apps you develop.",

Then our day-to-day life creeps back in and it gets hard to move those new ideas forward, becomes tricky to make space for learning the new skills we want, and we can feel isolated from the community we build here. If you can’t attend a conference at all, you can feel all of the above times two. \n\nAfter the conferences, how do we keep that inspiration and how do we stay accountable? For those who don’t have access to conferences or events, how can we make our community — and the inspiration we share — accessible all of the time? What are the obstacles that prevent us from making things happen? How might we build each other and our community up in the day to day, the quiet interludes between the big tent revivals?\n\nDuring this session we’ll work together to identify major obstacles that prevent follow through, and small groups will brainstorm ways to address those obstacles. We’ll leave with a clear sense of how we can collaborate with, contribute to and build our community outside of a conference bubble.",

But there are lots of them, and only one or two of us. So how do you say no to good ideas, while keeping those good ideas flowing? How do you tell senior editors that you don’t have the resources when they want Snowfall? How do you determine which of the good ideas has the most value journalistically, and/or most potential for audience, social sharing or revenue? Doing this poorly leads to missed opportunities, time wasted on projects with no legs or shelf life, journalistic flaws, poor execution because of overbooking your time or unrealistic expectations — and burnout from long hours, nights and weekends. Doing it well strengthens our journalism, builds audience and reputation, opens new revenue opportunities and leads to even more good ideas.

Some are still ongoing.\n\nSome organizations have used these failures to their advantage, leveraging them to create new teams within the newsroom, avoid existing IT structures, merge print and web operations, and the like. These projects and the challenges they face are not unique to media organizations. It turns out, the federal government is loaded with hobbled projects. In government, the failure that acted as the catalyst was healthcare.gov. After, the White House launched a new U.S. Digital Service and recruited some of the country's top digital minds to serve, to help transform government services.\n\nIt turns out, many of the problems we've all seen affecting large media organizations also affect large government agencies. As government has seen the same failures play out in dozens of projects, it means we're gaining a lot of experience in building effective digital services for citizens and federal employees. (Media organizations also need to build effective services for two constituencies -- its staff and its readers. ) For existing projects, we're getting really good at working through a series of plays to rescue them, and set teams and projects back on track.\n\nThis session will present what's been learned from the first year of the U.S. Digital Service, and how these lessons can be applied to building effective digital tools for writers and readers alike. We can discuss struggling projects at media organizations (you know, hypothetical struggling projects) and dream up how they might be rescued.",

Part of the workshop will be on the command-line, and part will be in the Flatsheet web application. You will need to install both the Dat command line-tool and the Flatsheet application on your own computer, and you will be able to do this at the start of the workshop (it only takes a couple of minutes).\n\nSome basic command-line experience (Mac, Linux or Windows) is necessary to get the most out of this workshop.\n\nMore about Dat and Flatsheet:\n\nDat (http://dat-data.com/) is an open source version control and data sharing tool for data sets. It comes with a command line tool called 'dat' that lets you do things like 'dat pull', 'dat diff', 'dat merge' and 'dat push'. The goal of dat is to let you automate your data workflows so you can share and consume changes to datasets with others easily.\n\nDat is funded by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and has a primary goal of being used by scientists to publish data for reproducible research and collaboration. It is currently in 'beta'.\n\nFlatsheet lets you edit data sets in realtime with your team. If you've used Google Spreadsheets with a library like Tabletop.js to create an ad-hoc mini-CMS, Flatsheet solves that problem more effectively, and is an open-source tool you can host on your own server. Flatsheet integrates with Dat, so you can use Dat to clone any sheet, edit locally, and push changes back to Flatsheet.\n\nFlatsheet recently received a grant from the Knight Prototype Fund, as well as a code sprint grant from OpenNews. You can see a work-in-progress example at http://data.seattle.io",

But writing the docs is still an afterthought for a lot of developers, something to check off a list at the last minute before moving on. The end result is a lot of wasted potential, great tools that put off potential users because nobody can figure out how they work.\n\nIn this session, we'll discuss patterns of effective documentation and our own experiences as both readers and writers. How do we balance readability and precision? How do we write docs that serve both beginners and experts? How do we choose good examples? How do we make writing the docs a first-class citizen of any project, something that feels integral and not like extra homework? When we're reading docs, what makes things click and what makes us give up? Finally, we'll split up into groups and break out the red pens for close readings of documentation from a selection of popular libraries, and maybe even make some pull requests with our edits.",

        "description": "As journalists, we know how useful LexisNexis can be. Companies do, too. And they are spending millions to build or buy sophisticated CRM systems that track and link their customers through not just social media and online buying preferences but also through public records. But we also know how flawed the data collected by these CRM systems and LexisNexis can be. Public records are not necessarily clean data. Nor do they often tell full stories on their own.\n\nHaving access to good data within the right context is immensely valuable. That’s in part why we’ve seen data stores such as ProPublica’s and the Texas Tribune’s show such promise. As we consider revenue streams to support good journalism, data may be one of those that gives us the resources and the independence we need. \n\nLet’s talk about how to best monetize data responsibly, ethically and without sacrificing journalistic standards. Proposed topics for discussion include: \n\n* What datasets should newsrooms be collecting as a matter of course — what is valuable? How should we define “valuable”?\n\n* How should these datasets be published? How much fact-checking is the right amount of fact-checking, particularly with significantly large datasets? What standards (if there should be standards) need to be put in place re: ideas such as version control, auditing back to the source and linking people within datasets? \n\n* Should all data be published? What are our responsibilities in terms of protecting privacy? How might our decisions on what to publish affect open records laws — could we see a backlash and how much should concern over that factor into our decision-making on what to publish? (For example, whether or not home addresses can be released by government agencies has been a huge topic in Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth Court recently ruled that agencies can’t release home addresses under the Right-to-Know Law without informing each person that his/her address would be released and giving them a chance to contest it. But this ruling doesn’t seem to apply to the release of home addresses in the voter registration database. Yet. If we use the voter registration database to map voters, how granular do we want to be in what we publish? How might that decision affect the state’s ongoing debate about the openness of those records?) \n\n* Let’s also talk about how, technically, these data “libraries” could be built — how can this idea of monetizing data work practically and efficiently, especially for small to mid-sized newsrooms?",

Let's make a kite and go for a walk around a Minneapolis lake or two. (Note: this requires some wind. But fear not, if there is no wind the backup plan is to do (helium) ballon mapping instead. Still cheaper than a drone).

Putting those same items on digital has essentially just been tagged onto the end of that process. But in many newsrooms this workflow doesn't work well for digital-only work, particularly when it involves data. \n\nWe’d like this session to be a work-group format with a goal to create the ideal workflow -- from idea germination to publication. This should include best practices for communication flows, deadlines, how/when items will be edited (for usability, clarity, style, grammar, spelling, etc), process for creating/sharing/discussing mockups, first drafts, etc. A very key piece should be who should be included in the process and when (and by “who” we want to identify skillsets, rather than specific job titles). Some of the questions that could be used as part of this discussion include: How and when should people (i.e. reporter, data wranglers, devs, editors, copy editors) get looped in? What are realistic time frames for getting a digital-only project completed (obviously dependant on the scope)? How should deadlines be used in this workflow? What skillsets are needed (this goes back to the “who” is involved piece) to ensure you’re producing high-quality digital product? \n\nWe’d like to split into three groups, each working on their own proposed workflows to address three different scenarios: 1) a digital product that accompanies an enterprise story that is weeks or months in the making, 2) a digital product that needs to be done quickly (either daily or short-term), either with or without a story\nand 3) a stand-alone digital-only product, such as a news app or tool which does not heavily feature a text component.\n\nWe realize many people attending the session come from organizations where there are a lot of road bumps that might need to be fixed before such a system could be put into place, but we don’t want to spend this session just talking about the problems. At the end of the session, we’ll combine the three groups to discuss the implementation piece. Who has had success? What worked, what didn't? How do you convince higher-ups that this should be a priority? How do you cut through the office politics?\n\nWe want to come up with an ideal workflow that can be used by newsrooms as a goal to achieve, since each newsroom will likely have its own unique problems to resolve before achieving it.",

Many of our approaches tend to focus on the disability or impairment we are trying to accommodate. What if we approached these challenges from the perspective of the hardware and software being used instead? When's the last time you tried navigating your site with just a keyboard? At 200% zoom? A Wiimote? As Anne Gibson puts it in her great A List Apart piece \"Reframing Accessibility on the Web,\" accessibility should not be just about determining \"your audience and building to their needs\" – accessibility should be a \"trait of the website itself.\" We'll chat about how we approach accessibility, touch on common misconceptions and mistakes and look into techniques to encourage mindfulness as we plan our projects.",

How can we add context and enticing entry points to turn that raw material into a resource for our readers? What approaches has your organization tried? What off-the-wall ideas would you like to try?\nThese questions are also relevant to the journalism we're producing now. Whether you're stretching the limits of the CMS or telling stories on platforms unlikely to exist a decade from now, how might you keep the archives of the future in mind? How do you balance the goals of preserving the content and preserving the material experience? How many Snapchat stories fit on a roll of microfilm? Let's find out, together.",

One of them is a bot that accepts pull requests to it's own code, based on the number of upvotes the pull request gets in the first half hour.

We all know that we value a “good team culture,” but we’re often vague about what that means or how to achieve it. But what if it’s as easy as setting out your team practices as a checklist, the same way you would for any other project? For instance, making sure that individual interactions between team members — even arguments — are approached in an “actively positive” manner? Or ensuring that every team member agrees and understands the grounds on which a proposed feature is judged?  Thinking about “culture,” precisely and vigorously, comes in especially handy when your team needs to onboard junior members, or when there’s a on-the job learning happening (which is, let’s admit it, all the freaking time). \n\nUsing techniques and advice from an industry that is all about making communication and relationships healthier, we’ll work together in this interactive workshop to create better frameworks for how we give and receive feedback. Participants will leave with actionable strategies for how to make space for criticism on their teams, how to wrangle all the egos, and simple ways we can encourage and support each other as we build things every day.",

How do you weigh the tradeoffs of S3 vs AWS vs something else? Does your app emit the best cache control headers? When should a feature be static, when not? How many databases should you be allowed to put in production? How do you monitor all of this stuff (both performance and errors)? When should you integrate with another service, when should you build it yourself? And now that you have all these internal services, how do you coordinate them?\n\nI built The Marshall Project’s website. Many of us build apps like this, whether it’s a news app, CMS, or plugin for an existing system. Let’s enumerate the choices we tackle when we build an app and explore their tradeoffs by sharing some war stories. At the end of the session, we’ll come away with a framework for asking the right questions when building your next app.",
