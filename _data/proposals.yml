Let's set aside imposter syndrome as quick as we can and discuss actively (re)shaping crummy projects, layered feedback and plateaued feelings into active learnings.  Part of that is intentionally *unlearning* habits — both skill and attitudes that stick.  Another facet is accommodating how we each learn differently — how to judge what stuff can percolate and what needs immediate patching.",

        "description": "Programming creates so many technical and creative inventions that it's natural for aspiring programmers to dream of big projects in the cloud. But this ambition ignores the actual goal of programming, which is almost completely about making machines do mundane work. And it is counterproductive to learning how to program, which requires consistent practice as in every other form of literacy and art. \n \nSo this session will be about mundane programming. Programming not to be the next Zuckerberg, or to get a better job 3 months from now, but to make today or just the next ten minutes more enjoyable. Instead of focusing specifically on how to code, we'll expand upon the reasons of why we code (though seeing is often believing when it comes to code, so feel free to bring both ideas and Gists). And we'll trim the personal prerequisites of programming, which don't include being an entrepreneur, having a profitable idea, building a website, contributing to open source, or changing the world or your career. Programming can be learned, and done, with a willingness to learn and a wide variety of small problems to practice upon.",

Sure, all the cool kids are using drones. But when journalists get arrested for trespassing when they are using their shiny + easy to spot drone to film correctional facilities, their colleague flying a kite is less likely to be stopped (what, I'm just flying my kite?). Let's make a kite and go for a walk around a Minneapolis lake or two. (Note: this requires some wind. But fear not, if there is no wind the backup plan is to do (helium) ballon mapping instead. Still cheaper than a drone). After kite-flying we'll have a look at the photos, stitch them together, contribute it Open Street Map and talk about some cool kite mapping projects.\n\n(this workshop will work over two days, day 1 mapping (a couple of hours), day 2 do some stuff with computers)",

It's something Brian Krebs has written about a number of times and it made me wonder if reporters and sources are fully prepared to face challenges like trumped up charges based on forged evidence given to police, financial fraud etc...\n\nIn this session, I'd like to discuss methods for protecting yourself and your family both at home and abroad.",
