        "description": "Working with code in organizations is a trade, involving craftsmanship and careful curation of content to build bold and clear narratives. Style guides and design patterns give us some frameworks for crafting simple, repeatable, and structured projects; likewise by committing to a pattern, we can forecast the utility of a project or interactive, and easily solicit contributions toward a more evolved and better-tested model for design. Still, as with documentation, these patterns can sometimes be forgotten, difficult to commit to, or lost in the tight timelines for interactive development and the driving need to introduce new and different interaction models. Let's collect a series of vetted design patterns and compose a quick reference for these guidelines based on themes; thereafter we can create a \"plain\" version that pulls from all references and might be worth incorporating into the exploratory planning stages of future interactives across newsrooms, disciplines, and projects. Maybe we can submit the output as an IRE tipsheet: https://www.ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/?q=newsrooms&page=2",

It combines scraping, analysis, notification and visualization in one easy tool. It works by assembling simple modules into a “workflow,” a repeatable, sharable, automatically updating pipeline that produces a publishable chart or a live API endpoint. And it's community driven: you can write modules for it in Python and Javascript -- say to scrape your favorite site -- and browse the large collection of modules that others have built.",

This generally boils down to issues with 3rd party content and advertising revenue streams that can be affected from the move. But there are also massive benefits to moving to HTTPS. Not just ensuring the privacy and security of our users— but there is also many new web APIs that require it.\n\nFor the session— we want to dive into the issues that we have faced, and how many of us are working within a new HTTPS world. We also want to look into the new web APIs that HTTPS opens up, and how they can be used on our own web experiences.",
