        "description": "The Computational Journalism Workbench is an integrated platform for data journalism, under development at Columbia journalism school.  It combines scraping, analysis, notification and visualization in one easy tool. It works by assembling simple modules into a “workflow,” a repeatable, sharable, automatically updating pipeline that produces a publishable chart or a live API endpoint. And it's community driven: you can write modules for it in Python and Javascript -- say to scrape your favorite site -- and browse the large collection of modules that others have built.",

A well-designed styleguide is the Swiss Army knife of the digital newsroom, allowing you to kick out everything from one-off bar charts to full fledged interactive presentations with a minimum of decisions and redundancy. In this session, we’ll talk about some of the elements to include in a successful style guide and some tools and strategies to implement one of your own.",

This generally boils down to issues with 3rd party content and advertising revenue streams that can be affected from the move. But there are also massive benefits to moving to HTTPS. Not just ensuring the privacy and security of our users— but there is also many new web APIs that require it.\n\nFor the session— we want to dive into the issues that we have faced, and how many of us are working within a new HTTPS world. We also want to look into the new web APIs that HTTPS opens up, and how they can be used on our own web experiences.",
