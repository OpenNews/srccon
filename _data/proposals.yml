More than that, can (and how) do we make independent journalism, the kind that doesn't thrive on ad impressions, work as a sustainable living, too? Models for money and payments have changed dramatically over the past few years - Spotify, Kickstarter, Patreon, etc., but few of these have made a real impact in the newsroom. Let's think cooperatively, and see what creative approaches the SRCCON community (i.e., not just biz-dev) has up their collective sleeves.",

A well-honed bootstrapping workflow to create a new project from scratch can save the day in a breaking news situation. But how you start your project can make all the difference whether the deadline is hours or weeks away. Your workflow can not only save you time, but also encourage best practices, ease collaboration and keep you sane. \n\nWe will describe and compare project scaffolding tools, news app templates and web development workflows. We will discuss how to make appropriate technical decisions for your team and project scope. And we will brainstorm features we wish our workflows had. Do you clone or scaffold? How do you manage technical debt and feature-creep? How do you prepare for the future?\n\nLet's share our best ideas for setting up our projects to succeed from the very start.",

As the tools we use for storytelling become not just more diverse but more constrained by the spectre of Terms Of Service, can we hedge our bets? Or to put it a different way, does our work to serve both third-party platforms and the websites that serve as our foundations actually constitute a zero-sum game? This session proposes that, by stepping back, we can imagine a workflow and toolset that serves both needs—and, by extension, newsrooms—even better than the current generation of content management systems.\n\nIn order to investigate this approach, we will ask three questions:\n\n1. Rather than abandon the benefits that the web affords us as a structure, how can we carry with us the ethos and process of the web as we negotiate these new platforms?\n2. Can our industry call upon a history of standards and protocols to avoid partner lock-in?\n3. Should our tools pivot from a focus on authorship to one of reportage and remixing, allowing us to use new platforms in focused ways without losing control over the source material?\n\nWhat if the web is the best idea? How can we retain the imperatives of the web as we serve the future of storytelling, and what are the kinds of tools and standards we can rally around to preserve that context while allowing us to experiment in other people's walled gardens?",

Using existing models for topic detection, natural language processing, and both supervised and unsupervised learning, we will investigate the boundaries of what reporters and machines do exceedingly well—all the while keeping a close eye on the singularity.

But I’ve also learned that it doesn’t have have to feel that way. Team dynamics, when positive, can play a huge part in making members feel included and heard. This plays an especially large roll when teams are split between multiple locations and/or include remote team members. Shared experiences and knowledge of each other’s lives can go a long way in helping teammates to become comfortable among one another. I have a couple of ideas about how to facilitate these kinds of relationships based on experiences within my own team, but I’m sure there are many, many more out there.

Person B realizes Person A likely made an error in the cleaning, tears apart draft, comes up with new insight. Person A goes back to square one, finds their error, redoes everything and sends it back. Person B questions their own judgement and sends the draft to Person C. Person C finds more errors Person B noticed but decided not to raise considering the hell they’d already put Person A through. Newsroom dissolves in a panic as Persons A, B and C all realize that this is going in next month’s issue so they’d better find, fix and spruce up these errors and fast.\nIn a slightly better world, Person A notices their error, asks Person B for help, Person B drops everything they’re doing, helps find the error in 100 lines of code and correct it, tries to explain what they did, and then, if they’re lucky, return to the work they were doing before. But again, newsroom panic is likely.\nWe think pair programming might be a way to short-circuit this cycle of agony and provide ways for small clusters of reporters to work together more effectively. For example, if Person A and Person B worked in tandem instead on projects like data cleaning, but also like writing, audio editing and page-designing, and helped catch errors early. That saves time and energy. We also think it could be a way to help build reusable skills in micro-newsrooms where multipurpose projects are a necessity. So instead of Person B simply correcting the error, they can correct the error in tandem with Person A so Person A can now fix that problem for themselves.\nWe don’t know for sure this will work but we want to try to out different models of collaboration. In essence, we’d like to run an experiment on a group of SRCCON attendees: Can pair programming and other forms of collaboration drawn from outside the journalism field help resolve some of our own intractable problems?\nHere’s what we imagine the session looking like:\nIntro discussion on what pair programming is, why people do it, what makes pairing different from other forms of collaboration (10 min)\nPairing activity - Attendees will split into pairs, pick a non-programming task (analyzing a data set, writing a script, editing audio, etc.) and use pair programming techniques to complete that task (25 min)\nGroups share their experiences (5 min)\nDiscussion - What other types of process from programming can we adopt in the newsroom?

However, many of those opportunities are clustered on the coasts and in major cities like New York, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. (See this article by Josh Beton for a great exploration of the problem: http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/03/the-game-of-concentration-the-internet-is-pushing-the-american-news-business-to-new-york-and-the-coasts/.) But there are a couple of major problems with this: (1) Journalists who don’t want to move to the coasts are forced to choose between living somewhere they love and advancing their career; (2) It sucks talent away from communities across the country who could benefit from coder journalists. So much vital data exists at the local level (examples: fossil fuel production, education performance, heroin use, political spending). The ability to analyze it locally is crucial to communities, who need information about their particular area -- not just national-level information.\nIn this session, we’ll start with a group-wide discussion identifying some of the challenges involved in coding off the coasts (attracting talent, mentorship and skill building, avoiding brain drain, assuring that there are desirable career paths for people who want to be coder journalists but don’t want to move to New York).

In this session, let's discuss successful and not so successful examples of \"too much data\", think about when is it time to give up the desire of \"show them all\", how to trim down information effectively to create a truly enjoyable experience for readers, and hopefully come up with a draft of guidelines for future practices.",

Based on the long-standing tradition of competitive journalism, being the first one to break a story is both intended and appreciated among journalists. However, what happens after breaking news is published isn’t widely discussed. This talk will fill in this gap by answering the following questions: 1) Is it beneficial to break a story as an absolutely first one? 2) Where do people get breaking news during major events? 3) How do search and social serve different roles in bringing traffic to various breaking stories?",

But what exactly is audience development? How do you find these magical creatures? What do they do? And can they really help connect your journalism with more people?\n\nThe simple answer is yes. If you do it right.\n\nFRONTLINE has had an audience development team for four years, and it has been transformative. We’ve learned that when our editorial and audience teams work side by side, hand in hand we CAN make magic together. We've seen double and triple digit growth across multiple platforms. But the process isn’t always easy, pretty or comfortable.\n\nIn this session we’ll have an open and honest conversation about our lessons learned. We’ll share stories of success and failures. And we’ll offer practical advice and tips for people who work in traditional newsrooms -- and for traditional bosses uncomfortable with thinking about audience.  We’d also open it up to the room to hear more about how other newsrooms are approaching this.",

Should we all become artists? I seriously thought about it last year. Here’s why: Whether we use text, images, graphics or code to tell stories, we deal with symbols, images, abstractions and interpretations every day. Journalism’s history is basically one of integrating new disciplines, techniques and technologies to more effectively tell stories. Lately, and especially for the data/tech community in news, that’s involved stats, social science, computer science and other quantitative- or science-oriented fields. Although we should continue to do this vigorously, we equally need to embrace the arts. And not just from a visual or design standpoint, but the ideas that underlie and advance art. In doing this, we can also see how seemingly disparate things correspond: cubism and physics, concrete poetry and GUIs, conceptual art and algorithms. We’ll explore these and other ways the analog humanities can help us think about digital media from technical and humanistic perspectives -- going everywhere from abstraction and to Afrofuturism.",

News organizations could be taking better advantage of what mobile devices track, delivering better news experiences by taking into account time of day and a user’s location and personal preferences. But how much information are users willing to give up about themselves? And where should we draw the line between offering valuable experiences and being overly invasive? \n\nThis workshop will prompt thinking about questions around privacy and mobile use, casting participants in the role of users (which we all are, anyway) and asking them to consider: What personal information would you be willing to give up for the sake of a news-focused digital service, and why? We’ll discuss the range of permissions that mobile developers have access to, and debate when and how they might be used to deliver better experiences. At the end the session we’ll have considered as a group the ways users may want to limit the personal data they share, and also what kinds of convenience or customization in news experiences on mobile would make the exchange of personal information more palatable.",

When your news app puts you or your organization in the position of power, how do you ensure the humans in the data are treated with empathy?

Then we'll break out into small teams and pick a typology, a medium (text, audio, video, or VR), and a persona, and create an analog demo with action figures, paper cutouts, and basic wireframes, to share the conversational experiences we've created.

AMP, FB Instant, and Apple News are just the start - mobile/responsive web, native apps, Instagram and Snapchat herald a world where your site isn't your site. Content needs to adapt and mutate in order to thrive. The Markdown/HTML-in, HTML-out model of CMSs of yore is falling by the wayside. Content producers in offices across the world are copy-and-pasting and cropping until their fingers bleed, just to keep up.\n\nBefore you argue that writers and editors should just write semantically rich HTML and CSS, thus effortlessly enabling seamless distribution across all these channels ... oh, wait, this is SRCCON and no-one would argue that. The web is great, but not perfect. HTML and CSS are incredible tools for developers and designers, but fall short at addressing the needs of writers and editors who want to publish beautiful stories, not learn the ins-and-outs of producing semantically rich (and correct) markup. For years, Markdown or WYSIWYG editors plus primitive \"raw HTML\" views have worked in tandem to address some of these shortcomings, but can't keep up in the long term while remaining usable for our writers and editors.\n\nWe've been working on some of these issues, and would love to explore the problems and potential solutions with the SRCCON community, since we're sure others are encountering the challenges of publishing beautiful, rich content simultaneously to many formats and contexts, too.",

This is our first experiment to being relevant sensor journalism to digital audiences.\n\nThrough this session, firstly we would like to share the importance of sensor based journalism and why we need to push it forward especially in todays’ times when everything is going digital and Internet of Things is becoming mainstream concept.\n\nSecondly, we would like to talk about our experience of building this map to make the data about air quality more accessible, meaningful and actionable. This will also give us a chance to share the challenges we faced and how we addressed them.\n\nLastly, we would like to share the importance of responsive design and user interaction in developing such platforms and how we worked on that. As we wanted to give users a seamless experience across all devices with easy navigation on the map.",

When a simple snapshot on Twitter has the instant potential to transform the way that someone views themselves inside of a system, data is a visceral and emotional companion to the news cycle.  That's because when you see a great visualization that connects truth with insight, you can't un-see it.  When the power to wield data is in the hands of the public, and people tell their own stories to each other,  data becomes a medium for civic art. \n\nThe question is, what happens to data when it crosses the chasm from analysis to impact?  How can small building blocks of information resonate with a broader narrative?  How can you design for this effect when you don't know what the data is going to say?\n\nThis workshop will arm participants with the practical (and emotional) tools every team needs to perform repeatable alchemy for powerful data storytelling.",

It is frequently the case that data from our digital footprints is used to predict our behavior and make decisions about the choices available to us. This unprecedented capacity to collect and analyze data has brought along with it a troubling dismissiveness of user agency, participation, and ownership. Such systems assume that it is an acceptable by-product for their users to have no understanding of the decisions being made about them and no agency in that decision-making process. For the most part, the invisibilized nature of these decisions are seen as a feature, not a bug, of a good user experience. As we begin to use algorithmic decision-making in areas of our lives that are increasingly high-stakes, it is essential that we create and utilize processes that maintain user agency and understanding.

However it's fair to say that 90% of daily traffic goes directly against stories published in the last week.\n\nArchive stories can hold a rich and unique mirror to the events of today, but face a number of challenges in being found and resurfaced: organization, classification, relevancy. Resurfacing content from even moderately sized archives is a challenge: often, it’s as much art as science. It is almost a brute force exercise to determine quality and notability. Yet we know there is a meaningful history and legacy buried there. How do we make sense of the present when we cannot easily access the past?\n\nWhy is this hard? We often think in historical terms over decades - and rarely in the smaller events that define our day to day. Staff across many departments may not have the necessary depth of knowledge about the archives to know where to draw from, and institutional knowledge is lost between generations. Metadata and taxonomy may not be established to help classify and surface. Tooling may not exist or may be inaccessible to guide making intelligent suggestions.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore working with your archives by talking about how we work with ours. Low-hanging fruit to bring gems to the surface, long-term strategies to make archives more accessible, and to ensure that today's content is accessible tomorrow.",

For fans of audio content, like podcasts, however, there are far fewer tools that allow them to engage with, comment on, and share their fandom of their favorite show. This creates a twofold problem: fans can't highlight, comment on, or share parts of their favorite podcast, and potential new listeners can't discover shows through those clips and highlights. In this session, we'll explore the idea of what \"giffable audio\" might be. We'll discuss what forms of expression we can support through giffable audio, what unique and interesting affordances audio (and more specifically, podcasts) might have, and how we can design tools that can create this new kind of audio culture on social media. We'll also discuss what tools and technologies currently exist in this realm, including our own project, Clipper, which is an in-progress web audio tool that allows podcast fans to clip audio into short, shareable snippets that can instantly be embedded on social media.",

Further, projects who bring some special character to their README benefit from attracting more users, earning more publicity and cross-postings, and can be lauded as \"cool\" even though the actually base project or tech functionality is buggy. That said, even if your tech is 110% awesome, you can lose people if your README, compile instructions, or general repository details are awkward or obscure.

There are countless uses for developers and tech-minded journalists in newsrooms, but the reporters there might not be equipped with the toolkit necessary to pursue those stories and provider better public service journalism. \nIn this session, I would like to take SRCCON's network of incredible, intelligent journalists and expand that to include reporters at small, local papers, whose continually watch their staffs shrink and budgets get cut. I believe we can form mentor-mentee relationships and come up with ways to teach small-paper journalists to think about data and code, even if it's done remotely (because the internet!). Throughout this session, I hope to brainstorm different ways to forge connections with other journalists; for instance, if you're based in New York City, this would be a great time to get in touch with fellow journalists in Buffalo and Schenectady. These connections would also give big city reporters a better eye into what's happening, and of course, story ideas, in smaller localities.",

Do they apply the same reasoning and critical thinking?  If not, why is that?  Understanding that life problems have different implications than work ones, it would be interesting to look at the differences and assess if they truly make life problems harder to approach. At work, it's not very recommended to ignore a task because it's hard, or painful. So why do it when it comes life problems that may affect our happiness?\nOn the other hand, if problem solvers keep the same pragmatic mentality in real life, has that proven to be successful? If so how do they keep a level head, and how to others receive it?\nWithout needing to go into private details, this session could be a short and interesting discussion on whether or not the work brain can be successfully applied to life.",

Whether you’re already captioning your videos or looking to get started let’s go through recently developed tools for making this easier including crowdsourcing (Amara) and Speech To Text (Trint) and how you can integrate them into your workflows publishing on YouTube and Facebook.",

The goal of listening to audiences isn’t a new one and is highly valuable for producing powerful news presentations. Yet many media organizations aren’t utilizing user research today because of lack of funds, recording equipment, physical space and/or expert guidance. In lacking easy ways to gain insights into people's busy lives, news teams can become overly dependent on their own instincts. This results in unimaginative story presentations and tired templates that fail to engage existing and would­-be audiences.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. Let’s discuss and sketch what a user research toolkit for distributed news teams might look like. What combination of methods for listening and observation (including but not limited to interviews, surveys, usability testing and co-­design techniques) would help your own team’s efforts? How can we best enable people working across functions to run their own audience research? What would it take for newsrooms to adopt a more flexible take on the traditional usability lab?

If you’re not on the tech side, you feel frustrated at hearing the phrase “tech debt” repeated over and over, without any apparent connection to your department’s priorities.\n\nIf we take a step back, we might find that debt isn't right metaphor for what we’re talking about. What we call \"tech debt\" is incurred not by individual debtors, but by organization-wide processes (or lack thereof). And unlike monetary debt, most tech debt can’t be paid off quickly, even if you have financial resources to throw at it. We need better ways to describe what tech debt is, how it builds up, and how to fix it, in terms that the whole company can understand.\n\nIn this session, I’ll talk about metaphors (such as home renovation) that have helped our newsroom unite in our success over considerable tech debt, and invite participants to share their own experiences of explaining or hearing about technical debt.

This internship could mean a shining opportunity, or it could mean realizing that they’re a heap of useless and don’t know anything. No pressure.\nFor mentors, they have jobs and projects and deadlines and bosses. They’re doing their best to keep up with editorial demands while staying current with the latest libraries and design trends. Then, every summer a heap of applications arrive on your desk, and they all look and sound the same. Eventually, the interns arrive and need to be on-boarded (not only with the org’s CMS, but also with the team’s development environment), brought up to speed on stories and ongoing projects, and given assignments all within a few days.

Do we get everyone on GitHub, explain branching, move to markdown, or is there something we can do with API's? Let's discuss how we can, and we can convince our colleagues of the benefits of, interdisciplinary collaboration.",

Nobody meant to cause Meyer harm, but thoughtlessness in the design of the feature (what he termed \"inadvertent algorithmic cruelty\") still left him shaken. And countless other examples abound.\n\nOf course, in the news industry, we're no strangers to accidental (and disastrous) juxtaposition: real estate ads placed next to stories on homelessness, bots that generate cringe-worthy content, and scheduled social media posts that go out during the worst kind of breaking news. In this session, we'll look at case studies of humane and inhumane design, practice identifying pitfalls in our news apps, and figure out how to care for our readers beyond just transmitting information.",
