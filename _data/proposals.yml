        "description": "Readers are increasingly relying on apps like Apple News and Facebook to get their news and relying less on directly sourcing information from media websites. If news organizations only publish stories on our own websites we’re missing out on a huge opportunity to read a wider, more diverse audience. However, investing engineering and design time into supporting a wide variety of platforms is not always feasible — each platform has their own set of constraints that makes building something for each is time consuming. With this session, we’d like to pose a few questions: How might we pare down interactivity to fit constraints of each platform without sacrificing innovation? How might we maintain quality of code and design when creating two or more versions of the same story? How might we make better tools to allow for more newsrooms to take advantage of publishing on distributed platforms?",

Radios are built into dozens of devices we use every day, and the radio spectrum is a tightly regulated, poorly understood invisible national asset. There are stories flying around in the air around you, and it’s time you started looking for them. Using the popular $20 RTL-SDR USB dongle (limited quantities will be provided at the workshop) we will get you up and running with the tools you’ll need to track aircraft flying over your head, listen to emergency responder radios and download weather satellite images WITHOUT THE INTERNET. We’ll also look at some interesting examples of how the radio spectrum has been used in reporting the news.",

If Brexit and the US election teach us one thing, it is that it may be time to step outside our comfort bubbles and start a conversation with the opposing view. \n\nNow suppose you land in another filter bubble full of despisers and disbelievers. How would you convince them that universal healthcare isn’t a bad idea, or that a strong dollar doesn’t translate into a strong US economy? How would you even start such a conversation? For more complicated political and economic issues, how would you help people move forward beyond face value and hearsay? If laying out facts doesn’t work, how can you approach others outside your own filter bubbles with a more accessible, heartfelt or persuasive approach?\n\nThe suggested encounter will not be easy.

Once those who want to share have shared, we'll divide into smaller groups based on similarity of moments (people who were taught to think this way by a mentor, people who had an interaction with an audience member, people who had some kind of formal empathy training, etc.). Those small groups will write up a quick explanation for why they think that particular experience was successful in changing their mindset. We'll come back together as a group and share the lessons with each other. \n\nPart 2: We'll learn about a specific method of empathy training and try it out. We would break up into groups, assign people specific publications and have them go through the exercise of putting together a persona — a thought-out target audience member with a specific background. Based on this persona, people will then think of ways to serve them with editorial content, story formats and outreach. Time permitting, each group will present their persona and approach.

Each category has four questions and you will get 1, 3, 5, or 7 points to wager on each question. The questions will be based off user research and academic studies about how people consume news. \n\nRound Two: Pictures. We will have screenshots of A/B tests from apps and websites of real publications. Players will need to guess which screenshot was the winning one. \n\nRound Three: Numbers. We will ask questions about the percentage of online users that engage in certain habits. The team that guesses the closest correct percentage wins the points. \n\nFinal Round: Guess the pub! We will read five clues (audience characteristics) of each publication. The earlier you guess the publication, the more points you get – but be careful, if you guess incorrectly you'll get 0 points! \n\nThe winning team will get something totally amazing, like tickets to Hamilton or a puppy. This pub quiz is a great way to have some fun, get to know other attendees, and learn something about the people who consume the content we create.

In this session we’ll get to some of the ways news organizations are making use of the existing research and the technical possibilities (and challenges) news organizations are up against, in an attempt to demystify the nuts and bolts of what goes into a recommendation system. What are the differences between content and item-based recommendations, how can you use mobile signals to inform these recommendations, and how do you decide what permutations are best for your news organization? We’ll try do that through what we promise will be a well-thought out, but ultimately probably strange game of tag.",

There are bunches of motivated and stoked people at the local level that want to find, process, and provide information to the public to help them be more informed. These civic hacktivists share an ethos with journalists. We should look to connect with local Code for America brigades to get more context at the local level until we actually achieve better geographic diversity in media.\n\nRebekah and Dave co-founded two Code for America brigades in Florida (Miami and Gainesville). Erie recently joined Code for America to help strengthen the network of brigades. This means they help connect hackers and activists with their local governments to find ways to make government work better for the people. Come and discuss tactics for connecting with local brigades to find data and better understand local issues, local people and local governments… since we know y’all don’t have people living there.",

        "description": "Working with code in organizations is a trade, involving craftsmanship and careful curation of content to build bold and clear narratives. Style guides and design patterns give us some frameworks for crafting simple, repeatable, and structured projects; likewise by committing to a pattern, we can forecast the utility of a project or interactive, and easily solicit contributions toward a more evolved and better-tested model for design. Still, as with documentation, these patterns can sometimes be forgotten, difficult to commit to, or lost in the tight timelines for interactive development and the driving need to introduce new and different interaction models. Let's collect a series of vetted design patterns and compose a quick reference for these guidelines based on themes; thereafter we can create a \"plain\" version that pulls from all references and might be worth incorporating into the exploratory planning stages of future interactives across newsrooms, disciplines, and projects. Maybe we can submit the output as an IRE tipsheet: https://www.ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/?q=newsrooms&page=2",
