Having grown reliant on social distribution to reach new audiences, Publishers who had only ever dictated their terms of distribution had to learn to adapt their already-aging business models to walled gardens, new ways to measure reach and engagement, and work within Other People’s Priorities. Content format compatibility issues, maintaining wholly separate designs inside of early-stage platforms with low feature-sets, participation being equally opt-in and required to maintain SEO and reach, reduced ad opportunities, and gaps in analytics...it was a lot to take in. But publishers are doing more than making the best of it: they’re thriving.\n\nIn this session, we’ll look at what we’ve learned from learning to adapt. Your humble hosts will draw from their experience at The New Yorker, Pitchfork, Wired, Quartz, Hearst, and Condé Nast to offer a survey of the technologies and strategies publishers have created to navigate this uncharted frontier. We’ll discuss how our organizations monitor engagement, drive subscriptions and revenue, and balance our legacy systems with the needs these new platforms oblige.",

As someone who has spent a fair amount of time in the uneasy space between art and journalism, I think there are extremely important lessons the two fields can learn from each other, and in recent history the research-intensive approach of some conceptual artists could be mistaken for journalism. Frankly, the differences between data visualizations by tech artists and visualizations by reporters are often negligible. But the things that make art valuable are, to some extent, the reasons it can't and shouldn't be journalism. This session will look both at some of the ethical and creative dilemmas of the artist-journalist blurring, as well as examples of working through those dilemmas toward productive collaboration.",

Should we all become artists? I seriously thought about it a couple years ago. Here’s why: Whether we use text, images, graphics or code to tell stories, we deal with symbols, images, abstractions and interpretations every day. Journalism’s history is basically one of integrating new disciplines, techniques and technologies to more effectively tell stories. Lately for the data/tech community in news, that’s mostly involved stats, social science, computer science and other quantitative- or science-oriented fields. Although we should continue to do this vigorously, we equally need to embrace the arts. And not just from a visual or design standpoint, but for the ideas that underlie and advance art. In doing this, we can also see how seemingly disparate things relate -- like cubism and physics, concrete poetry and GUIs or conceptual art and algorithms. We’ll explore these and other ways the analog humanities can help us think about digital media from technical and humanistic perspectives -- going everywhere from abstraction to Afrofuturism.",

They write stories, take photos, record audio, shoot video, manage a website and interact with the audience on social media. They’re dedicated to their mission of finding and sharing news, but they face challenges: it’s difficult to recruit media professionals to rural areas; burnout is common; and many news organizations lack the knowledge and training necessary to incorporate new technology. Nonetheless, they push forward. Some are trying new storytelling methods, learning new technology and developing innovative ways to reach and grow their audience. They are small, but mighty. And with a little help, they could be mightier. Let’s have a conversation about the challenges small, rural organizations face, and then brainstorm the best ways to help them. Maybe that’s through new technology, or training that’s accessible to them where they work. It may be as simple as a virtual support network that ties small newsrooms together so they can encourage each other and share best practices. As these rural news operations grow stronger and become more digital, they’ll be able to share their stories with a wider audience. That will benefit the individual organizations, but it will also help the wider audience - the cities and the coasts - see a more complete picture of the country.",

The huge variety of excellent tools, manuals, links and best practices regarding digital security for journalists can be hard to navigate.  Those helpful indices and best-of guides that do exist are not assembled collaboratively by the community of journalists who use them and are sometimes updated only sporadically, if at all.   In this focused working session, we’ll break into rotating groups to assemble a list of the best resources in three areas:  security guides and getting-started resources, secure communication tools/practices and personal digital security resources.  Through the magic of Github/Pages, we’ll publish our work by the end of the session and establish a framework for future contributions.  Everyone will leave this session with not only a new, useful resource, but also the invitation, ability and (hopefully) motivation to edit and evolve it into the future.",

Going headless with React?\n\n...or is your newsroom paralyzed by the sheer magnitude of the task of choosing and migrating to a new CMS, let along upgrading your current one?\n\nThis session is about the why and how of migrating your content to new systems. When is it time to change up your CMS, and why? When is it better to repair your ship instead of jumping off? What does the transition process look like-- for instance, how do you handle your archival stories, or make sure your frontend and backend features are in sync? How do you pull it off (technically)? How do you pull it off (organizationally)? Most importantly: was it worth it?",

Yet in many newsrooms, we miss this opportunity and only engage our audiences post-publication. Often, we think of user research as something used exclusively for developing technology platforms. But it’s applicable to all kinds of newsroom workflows, from editorial to design to engagement to business development. Creating processes to learn and improve user experiences (UX) can lead to more inclusive digital platforms, content, and tools that share information and engage audiences. \n\nWhen is user feedback valuable? Pretty much always: during the ideation, creation or validation phases for content, platforms, tools and experiences. However, at each of these stages, how and why we use audience feedback is subtly different. So, to navigate this process, we will work together to draw a project roadmap that outlines what types of user feedback can be collected at each stage, and what methods are most appropriate. We’ll identify and practice some impactful ways to gather and respond to user feedback. We will also brainstorm audience engagement tactics, such as: usability testing of interactive graphics on mobile devices, focus groups to decide next steps after a story is produced, or co-designing processes for audiences to engage with your organization in new ways.",

The purpose of the game is to give digital professionals (i.e. designers and developers) and stakeholders (i.e. editorial and business leaders) the experience of collaborating on a project without actually having to produce any work.\n\nOur seventy-five minutes are carefully planned. We'll spend ten minutes getting into teams and going over the rules, then we'll have one ten minute first round followed by nine five minute rounds. We'll spend the last few minutes reviewing the results, announcing the winner, and debriefing, and we'll share an explanation of the gameplay and scoring with all the players that they can take with them.\n\nAttendees will be quickly split into teams at the beginning of the session based on their role within their organization, and each team will be given a deck of playing cards, plus a budget and a number of person-hours. Teams play their cards using a computer (one laptop is necessary per team) so that scores and account balances update in real time.\n\nEach card is a user story, which costs person-hours and money to produce. Most cards require multiple turns to complete. Each turn represents a Sprint (in Agile sense) and lasts five minutes. A projector at the front of the room shows time remaining in the turn.\n\nEach user story has a point value, but the value of each user story isn't printed on the corresponding card, since product development is never that easy! The short project brief which all teams receive, and a comprehensive audience research report which teams can buy out of their allocated budget provide hints as to which stories are most valuable. Exceeding allotted time or cash budgets can impact the final score too.\n\nAs players engage in the game, what they’ll find is that there are a lot of tradeoffs. Work on lots of features poorly, or just one or two really well? Spend money on research, or save money and hope for the best? Skip QA to spend engineering hours on new features, or make sure all the bugs are squashed?\n\nThe product game is presented by Austin Smith, CEO of Alley Interactive, and Dan Maccarone, CEO of Charming Robot, but make no mistake: this isn't a talk and we won’t have a slideshow, this is an entirely collaborative experience. We bring our experience executing dozens of projects to the game design, but the game itself is a fun workout for collaboration on digital teams, not a tutorial in product development.\n\nWe've played The Product Game twice: we debuted it at the WordPress.com VIP Workshop in 2015, and presented it again at Tribune Media in Chicago. These games focused on building a complete ad-supported digital news product. We'll design a completely new case study for SRCCON which will feature a data-driven news app at a fictional news organization that must integrate with various existing systems, and we'll custom print SRCCON cards with the user stories that will yield a finished product.",

The label read: “put finger in hole.”\n\nFluxus artists were playful revolutionaries who tried to undermine the authority of the museum, and the primacy of the artist, often by requiring the viewer to the complete (and, in doing so, co-create) a piece of art.  To many of us, interactive has become a noun.  But how interactive is your interactive, really?  When’s the last time you stopped to consider just how revolutionary an idea it is to include your reader in the completion (or co-creation) of your work as a journalist?\n\nIn this session, we will disengage from our newsrooms and our tools and our data sets for a while and think about the essence of interaction.  What entices us to reach beyond ourselves and affect the world?  What do we expect?  What makes those experiences rewarding?  Is there a difference between exploration and interaction?  How does individual action differ from communal participation?\n\nAlong the way, we’ll consider a range of contrived, non-journalistic, interactive experiences: religious services, Fluxus happenings, game nights, and dance parties.  And we’ll ask why some experiences that invite interaction meet with indifference or refusal.\n\nFinally, we will take our inspiration and create instructions for building a digital interactive experience, and exchange them with each other.  Take your instructions home.  Follow them.  After SRCCON, we’ll publish all the interactives together as new sNerdFluxkit (2017).",

We particularly look for the audience to share their views and experience on news tags and taxonomies, what problems they have had or know of and ways they could be solved.

We’ll also talk about how to get the rest of your newsroom to think in a data-driven mindset while reporting, and leave with some story ideas to take back with us.",

Indeed, we comfortably sympathize with the views of our political parties, influencers and friends, and ignore the banter; in fact, Fox News viewers believe the news they watch is “fair and balanced”, while CNN watchers dismiss the idea that they could possibly be consuming “fake news.”  But why such polarization and how did we get here?  If Brexit and the US election teach us one thing, it is that it may be time to step outside our comfort bubbles and start a conversation with the opposing view. \n\nNow suppose you land in another filter bubble full of despisers and disbelievers. How would you convince them that universal healthcare isn’t a bad idea, or that a strong dollar doesn’t translate into a strong US economy? How would you even start such a conversation? For more complicated political and economic issues, how would you help people move forward beyond face value and hearsay? If laying out facts doesn’t work, how can you approach others outside your own filter bubbles with a more accessible, heartfelt or persuasive approach?\n\nThe suggested encounter will not be easy. But filter bubbles won’t burst by themselves. It is up to us to take them on, and we are conscientious and badass enough to pull it off!",

This session is about recognizing those moments, and strategizing how to create them for your coworkers.\n\nPart 1: The session would begin with a few people sharing with the whole group about their \"lightbulb\" moment — the point in time when they shifted their thinking about their audience they're serving. Once those who want to share have shared, we'll divide into smaller groups based on similarity of moments (people who were taught to think this way by a mentor, people who had an interaction with an audience member, people who had some kind of formal empathy training, etc.). Those small groups will write up a quick explanation for why they think that particular experience was successful in changing their mindset. We'll come back together as a group and share the lessons with each other. \n\nPart 2: We'll learn about a specific method of empathy training and try it out. We would break up into groups, assign people specific publications and have them go through the exercise of putting together a persona — a thought-out target audience member with a specific background. Based on this persona, people will then think of ways to serve them with editorial content, story formats and outreach. Time permitting, each group will present their persona and approach.

We will have screenshots of A/B tests from apps and websites of real publications. Players will need to guess which screenshot was the winning one. \n\nRound Three: Numbers. We will ask questions about the percentage of online users that engage in certain habits. The team that guesses the closest correct percentage wins the points. \n\nFinal Round: Guess the pub! We will read five clues (audience characteristics) of each publication. The earlier you guess the publication, the more points you get – but be careful, if you guess incorrectly you'll get 0 points! \n\nThe winning team will get something totally amazing, like tickets to Hamilton or a puppy.

This session, or therapy circle, would explore real strategies to overcome whatever personality traits participants may have that hinders their journalism. For example, to deal with my debilitating anxiety attacks that precede asking colleagues or sources to do something for me, I put my 'roller derby hat' on and become a whole new person to become as fierce and unapologetic as I am on the track beating up and getting beaten up by other women.

Not very many great resources exist, testing can be a pain, and just figuring out where to start can leave you scratching your head. Thinking about it in the context of journalism and visual storytelling — where content is dominant and often unpredictable — can be even more confusing. As a result, if accessibility gets thought about at all, it’s often an afterthought. If you’re someone who needs an accessible site, you’re left wandering in an information wasteland.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way! Building accessible content and interfaces — even on tight deadlines — is completely doable. You just have to think about it from the beginning. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of basic accessibility principles, tools, and testing. We’ll then break into groups and look at those principles in the context of journalism — testing some apps, looking at alt text, debating the pros and cons of delivering alternative experiences and and dissecting data visualizations and sites in a way that will help you think about how usable the site really is. You’ll walk away with a sheaf of resources, practical tips to improve your next project and, hopefully, a new understanding of what accessibility on the web can look like.",

        "description": "Working with code in organizations is a trade, involving craftsmanship and careful curation of content to build bold and clear narratives. Style guides and design patterns give us some frameworks for crafting simple, repeatable, and structured projects; likewise by committing to a pattern, we can forecast the utility of a project or interactive, and easily solicit contributions toward a more evolved and better-tested model for design. Still, as with documentation, these patterns can sometimes be forgotten, difficult to commit to, or lost in the tight timelines for interactive development and the driving need to introduce new and different interaction models. Let's collect a series of vetted design patterns and compose a quick reference for these guidelines based on themes; thereafter we can create a \"plain\" version that pulls from all references and might be worth incorporating into the exploratory planning stages of future interactives across newsrooms, disciplines, and projects. Maybe we can submit the output as an IRE tipsheet: https://www.ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/?q=newsrooms&page=2",

        "description": "The Computational Journalism Workbench is an integrated platform for data journalism, under development at Columbia journalism school.  It combines scraping, analysis, notification and visualization in one easy tool. It works by assembling simple modules into a “workflow,” a repeatable, sharable, automatically updating pipeline that produces a publishable chart or a live API endpoint. And it's community driven: you can write modules for it in Python and Javascript -- say to scrape your favorite site -- and browse the large collection of modules that others have built.",

This generally boils down to issues with 3rd party content and advertising revenue streams that can be affected from the move. But there are also massive benefits to moving to HTTPS. Not just ensuring the privacy and security of our users— but there is also many new web APIs that require it.\n\nFor the session— we want to dive into the issues that we have faced, and how many of us are working within a new HTTPS world. We also want to look into the new web APIs that HTTPS opens up, and how they can be used on our own web experiences.",
