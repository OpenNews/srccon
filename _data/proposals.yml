It's something Brian Krebs has written about a number of times and it made me wonder if reporters and sources are fully prepared to face challenges like trumped up charges based on forged evidence given to police, financial fraud etc...\n\nIn this session, I'd like to discuss methods for protecting yourself and your family both at home and abroad.",

This session will look at how some journalists have used machine learning and in what situations it's best and in what situations it should be avoided.",
