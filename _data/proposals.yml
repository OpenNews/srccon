        "description": "Readers are increasingly relying on apps like Apple News and Facebook to get their news and relying less on directly sourcing information from media websites. If news organizations only publish stories on our own websites we’re missing out on a huge opportunity to read a wider, more diverse audience. However, investing engineering and design time into supporting a wide variety of platforms is not always feasible — each platform has their own set of constraints that makes building something for each is time consuming. With this session, we’d like to pose a few questions: How might we pare down interactivity to fit constraints of each platform without sacrificing innovation? How might we maintain quality of code and design when creating two or more versions of the same story? How might we make better tools to allow for more newsrooms to take advantage of publishing on distributed platforms?",

Radios are built into dozens of devices we use every day, and the radio spectrum is a tightly regulated, poorly understood invisible national asset. There are stories flying around in the air around you, and it’s time you started looking for them. Using the popular $20 RTL-SDR USB dongle (limited quantities will be provided at the workshop) we will get you up and running with the tools you’ll need to track aircraft flying over your head, listen to emergency responder radios and download weather satellite images WITHOUT THE INTERNET. We’ll also look at some interesting examples of how the radio spectrum has been used in reporting the news.",

Indeed, we comfortably sympathize with the views of our political parties, influencers and friends, and ignore the banter; in fact, Fox News viewers believe the news they watch is “fair and balanced”, while CNN watchers dismiss the idea that they could possibly be consuming “fake news.”  But why such polarization and how did we get here?  If Brexit and the US election teach us one thing, it is that it may be time to step outside our comfort bubbles and start a conversation with the opposing view. \n\nNow suppose you land in another filter bubble full of despisers and disbelievers. How would you convince them that universal healthcare isn’t a bad idea, or that a strong dollar doesn’t translate into a strong US economy? How would you even start such a conversation? For more complicated political and economic issues, how would you help people move forward beyond face value and hearsay? If laying out facts doesn’t work, how can you approach others outside your own filter bubbles with a more accessible, heartfelt or persuasive approach?\n\nThe suggested encounter will not be easy.

This session is about recognizing those moments, and strategizing how to create them for your coworkers.\n\nPart 1: The session would begin with a few people sharing with the whole group about their \"lightbulb\" moment — the point in time when they shifted their thinking about their audience they're serving. Once those who want to share have shared, we'll divide into smaller groups based on similarity of moments (people who were taught to think this way by a mentor, people who had an interaction with an audience member, people who had some kind of formal empathy training, etc.). Those small groups will write up a quick explanation for why they think that particular experience was successful in changing their mindset. We'll come back together as a group and share the lessons with each other. \n\nPart 2: We'll learn about a specific method of empathy training and try it out. We would break up into groups, assign people specific publications and have them go through the exercise of putting together a persona — a thought-out target audience member with a specific background. Based on this persona, people will then think of ways to serve them with editorial content, story formats and outreach. Time permitting, each group will present their persona and approach.

Each category has four questions and you will get 1, 3, 5, or 7 points to wager on each question. The questions will be based off user research and academic studies about how people consume news. \n\nRound Two: Pictures. We will have screenshots of A/B tests from apps and websites of real publications. Players will need to guess which screenshot was the winning one. \n\nRound Three: Numbers. We will ask questions about the percentage of online users that engage in certain habits. The team that guesses the closest correct percentage wins the points. \n\nFinal Round: Guess the pub! We will read five clues (audience characteristics) of each publication. The earlier you guess the publication, the more points you get – but be careful, if you guess incorrectly you'll get 0 points! \n\nThe winning team will get something totally amazing, like tickets to Hamilton or a puppy. This pub quiz is a great way to have some fun, get to know other attendees, and learn something about the people who consume the content we create.

In this session we’ll get to some of the ways news organizations are making use of the existing research and the technical possibilities (and challenges) news organizations are up against, in an attempt to demystify the nuts and bolts of what goes into a recommendation system. What are the differences between content and item-based recommendations, how can you use mobile signals to inform these recommendations, and how do you decide what permutations are best for your news organization? We’ll try do that through what we promise will be a well-thought out, but ultimately probably strange game of tag.",

There are bunches of motivated and stoked people at the local level that want to find, process, and provide information to the public to help them be more informed. These civic hacktivists share an ethos with journalists. We should look to connect with local Code for America brigades to get more context at the local level until we actually achieve better geographic diversity in media.\n\nRebekah and Dave co-founded two Code for America brigades in Florida (Miami and Gainesville). Erie recently joined Code for America to help strengthen the network of brigades. This means they help connect hackers and activists with their local governments to find ways to make government work better for the people. Come and discuss tactics for connecting with local brigades to find data and better understand local issues, local people and local governments… since we know y’all don’t have people living there.",

Still, as with documentation, these patterns can sometimes be forgotten, difficult to commit to, or lost in the tight timelines for interactive development and the driving need to introduce new and different interaction models. Let's collect a series of vetted design patterns and compose a quick reference for these guidelines based on themes; thereafter we can create a \"plain\" version that pulls from all references and might be worth incorporating into the exploratory planning stages of future interactives across newsrooms, disciplines, and projects.

Frankly, the differences between data visualizations by tech artists and visualizations by reporters are often negligible. But the things that make art valuable are, to some extent, the reasons it can't and shouldn't be journalism.

Should we all become artists? I seriously thought about it a couple years ago. Here’s why: Whether we use text, images, graphics or code to tell stories, we deal with symbols, images, abstractions and interpretations every day. Journalism’s history is basically one of integrating new disciplines, techniques and technologies to more effectively tell stories. Lately for the data/tech community in news, that’s mostly involved stats, social science, computer science and other quantitative- or science-oriented fields. Although we should continue to do this vigorously, we equally need to embrace the arts. And not just from a visual or design standpoint, but for the ideas that underlie and advance art. In doing this, we can also see how seemingly disparate things relate -- like cubism and physics, concrete poetry and GUIs or conceptual art and algorithms. We’ll explore these and other ways the analog humanities can help us think about digital media from technical and humanistic perspectives -- going everywhere from abstraction to Afrofuturism.",

The unmaintainable solipsistic mess that always seems to result from giving editors access to tweak the raw HTML. The arcane incantations of Markdown, a hex cast by console-dwelling developers to curse users for their ever-stymying needs. AMP, Apple News, and FBIA, those trojan horses of platform control over publishing, the life-blood of content.\n\nWe spend a lot of time trying to massage content into the right forms in order to display it efficiently, and most importantly to create interesting new ways for authors, editors, and designers to express their ideas creatively and efficiently. The proliferation of device form factors isn’t helping to make it easy.\n\nThis discussion is intended to be a space for attendees to share their frustrations with existing systems, and their current attemptsto address these problems. We’d also like explore the significant possibilities that could emerge from [a] shared and extensible approach[es] to content storage.",

They write stories, take photos, record audio, shoot video, manage a website and interact with the audience on social media. They’re dedicated to their mission of finding and sharing news, but they face challenges: it’s difficult to recruit media professionals to rural areas; burnout is common; and many news organizations lack the knowledge and training necessary to incorporate new technology. Nonetheless, they push forward. Some are trying new storytelling methods, learning new technology and developing innovative ways to reach and grow their audience. They are small, but mighty. And with a little help, they could be mightier. Let’s have a conversation about the challenges small, rural organizations face, and then brainstorm the best ways to help them. Maybe that’s through new technology, or training that’s accessible to them where they work. It may be as simple as a virtual support network that ties small newsrooms together so they can encourage each other and share best practices. As these rural news operations grow stronger and become more digital, they’ll be able to share their stories with a wider audience. That will benefit the individual organizations, but it will also help the wider audience - the cities and the coasts - see a more complete picture of the country.",

First, we will compare and contrast what we deem fundamentally safe and unsafe on an individual level. We will see how culture, ethnicity, upbringings, and general background influence us. For instance, what would be the differences between a Black woman’s definition of safety and that of a Latino man.\nThese definitions will be compared to the workplace’s environment. How closely do these align? With the comparison’s results, we will take a deeper look at:\n- how companies maintain safe spaces (or why it isn’t working)\n- diversity in leadership: how leadership is involved + leadership demographics and how it correlates to safety\n- transparency and communication in the company\n- and more…\nDuring the discussion’s last segment, I would love for us all to create a short ‘safety kit’ that we can all keep for future reference, and maybe share with our companies!

Syndication platforms need rendering pipelines—should you extract a reusable system from your owned-and-operated platform? You have plans for a more responsive and API-client-driven toolset—why couple it with your websites? The last five years have completely transformed the way we conceive of CMS architectures, potentially leading to dramatically more granular and focused microsystems.

Most importantly: how, by being thoughtful about the structures of our teams, can we infer smart and maintainable systems that are built to expect the unexpected?\n\nConway’s Law can wreak havoc on teams as they pivot from monoliths to modular content management platforms. In this session, we'll learn how to carefully delineate the boundaries between systems and teams to reduce crosstalk and latency (for networks of both servers and people), talk through the many Disciplines of Content to help divide team responsibilities, and think about notions of ownership and stewardship when you have twice as many codebases as engineers on your teams.",

Yet in many newsrooms, we miss this opportunity and only engage our audiences post-publication. Often, we think of user research as something used exclusively for developing technology platforms. But it’s applicable to all kinds of newsroom workflows, from editorial to design to engagement to business development. Creating processes to learn and improve user experiences (UX) can lead to more inclusive digital platforms, content, and tools that share information and engage audiences. \n\nWhen is user feedback valuable? Pretty much always: during the ideation, creation or validation phases for content, platforms, tools and experiences. However, at each of these stages, how and why we use audience feedback is subtly different. So, to navigate this process, we will work together to draw a project roadmap that outlines what types of user feedback can be collected at each stage, and what methods are most appropriate. We’ll identify and practice some impactful ways to gather and respond to user feedback. We will also brainstorm audience engagement tactics, such as: usability testing of interactive graphics on mobile devices, focus groups to decide next steps after a story is produced, or co-designing processes for audiences to engage with your organization in new ways.",

The purpose of the game is to give digital professionals (i.e. designers and developers) and stakeholders (i.e. editorial and business leaders) the experience of collaborating on a project without actually having to produce any work.\n\nOur seventy-five minutes are carefully planned. We'll spend ten minutes getting into teams and going over the rules, then we'll have one ten minute first round followed by nine five minute rounds. We'll spend the last few minutes reviewing the results, announcing the winner, and debriefing, and we'll share an explanation of the gameplay and scoring with all the players that they can take with them.\n\nAttendees will be quickly split into teams at the beginning of the session based on their role within their organization, and each team will be given a deck of playing cards, plus a budget and a number of person-hours. Teams play their cards using a computer (one laptop is necessary per team) so that scores and account balances update in real time.\n\nEach card is a user story, which costs person-hours and money to produce. Most cards require multiple turns to complete. Each turn represents a Sprint (in Agile sense) and lasts five minutes. A projector at the front of the room shows time remaining in the turn.\n\nEach user story has a point value, but the value of each user story isn't printed on the corresponding card, since product development is never that easy! The short project brief which all teams receive, and a comprehensive audience research report which teams can buy out of their allocated budget provide hints as to which stories are most valuable. Exceeding allotted time or cash budgets can impact the final score too.\n\nAs players engage in the game, what they’ll find is that there are a lot of tradeoffs. Work on lots of features poorly, or just one or two really well? Spend money on research, or save money and hope for the best? Skip QA to spend engineering hours on new features, or make sure all the bugs are squashed?\n\nThe product game is presented by Austin Smith, CEO of Alley Interactive, and Dan Maccarone, CEO of Charming Robot, but make no mistake: this isn't a talk and we won’t have a slideshow, this is an entirely collaborative experience. We bring our experience executing dozens of projects to the game design, but the game itself is a fun workout for collaboration on digital teams, not a tutorial in product development.\n\nWe've played The Product Game twice: we debuted it at the WordPress.com VIP Workshop in 2015, and presented it again at Tribune Media in Chicago. These games focused on building a complete ad-supported digital news product. We'll design a completely new case study for SRCCON which will feature a data-driven news app at a fictional news organization that must integrate with various existing systems, and we'll custom print SRCCON cards with the user stories that will yield a finished product.",

The label read: “put finger in hole.”\n\nFluxus artists were playful revolutionaries who tried to undermine the authority of the museum, and the primacy of the artist, often by requiring the viewer to the complete (and, in doing so, co-create) a piece of art.  To many of us, interactive has become a noun.  But how interactive is your interactive, really?  When’s the last time you stopped to consider just how revolutionary an idea it is to include your reader in the completion (or co-creation) of your work as a journalist?\n\nIn this session, we will disengage from our newsrooms and our tools and our data sets for a while and think about the essence of interaction.  What entices us to reach beyond ourselves and affect the world?  What do we expect?  What makes those experiences rewarding?  Is there a difference between exploration and interaction?  How does individual action differ from communal participation?\n\nAlong the way, we’ll consider a range of contrived, non-journalistic, interactive experiences: religious services, Fluxus happenings, game nights, and dance parties.  And we’ll ask why some experiences that invite interaction meet with indifference or refusal.\n\nFinally, we will take our inspiration and create instructions for building a digital interactive experience, and exchange them with each other.  Take your instructions home.  Follow them.  After SRCCON, we’ll publish all the interactives together as new sNerdFluxkit (2017).",

When is Machine Learning useful? And where do we get taxonomies from? Then, we will present EXTRA (“EXTraction Rules Apparatus”), an open source project that was developed by IPTC (https://iptc.org) with the support of Google DNI and allows news editors to precisely identify the categories to which a piece of news belongs to. The system manages to recommend the most relevant categories using Boolean rules, with sophisticated natural language processing capabilities. We particularly look for the audience to share their views and experience on news tags and taxonomies, what problems they have had or know of and ways they could be solved. Then we will show how this new open source tool can help editors in newsrooms build their own taxonomy system and will let the participants interact with the system and try building their own rules to categorize news stories.",

If news organizations only publish stories on our own websites we’re missing out on a huge opportunity to read a wider, more diverse audience. However, investing engineering and design time into supporting a wide variety of platforms is not always feasible — each platform has their own set of constraints that makes building something for each is time consuming. With this session, we’d like to pose a few questions: How might we pare down interactivity to fit constraints of each platform without sacrificing innovation? How might we maintain quality of code and design when creating two or more versions of the same story? How might we make better tools to allow for more newsrooms to take advantage of publishing on distributed platforms?",

Research shows bombarding people with more facts doesn’t work to change their mind, particularly if they see those with the facts as part of a ‘cultural elite’.\n\nThis session will ask participants to consider how they currently include experts in their storytelling, and workshop some alternatives. By telling stories in more innovative ways, we can help counter the death of expertise, restoring some of the trust that has been eroded in media.",

What did it take for you to start seeing them as real people that you *want* to serve, not just eyeballs to count or users to get to perform a specific action? This session is about recognizing those moments, and strategizing how to create them for your coworkers.\n\nPart 1: The session would begin with a few people sharing with the whole group about their \"lightbulb\" moment — the point in time when they shifted their thinking about their audience they're serving. Once those who want to share have shared, we'll divide into smaller groups based on similarity of moments (people who were taught to think this way by a mentor, people who had an interaction with an audience member, people who had some kind of formal empathy training, etc.). Those small groups will write up a quick explanation for why they think that particular experience was successful in changing their mindset. We'll come back together as a group and share the lessons with each other. \n\nPart 2: We'll learn about a specific method of empathy training and try it out. We would break up into groups, assign people specific publications and have them go through the exercise of putting together a persona — a thought-out target audience member with a specific background. Based on this persona, people will then think of ways to serve them with editorial content, story formats and outreach. Time permitting, each group will present their persona and approach. (If time is running short, the groups will pair and present to one other group.)",

Each category has four questions and you will get 1, 3, 5, or 7 points to wager on each question. The questions will be based off user research and academic studies about how people consume news. \n\nRound Two: Pictures. We will have screenshots of A/B tests from apps and websites of real publications. Players will need to guess which screenshot was the winning one. \n\nRound Three: Numbers. We will ask questions about the percentage of online users that engage in certain habits. The team that guesses the closest correct percentage wins the points. \n\nFinal Round: Guess the pub! We will read five clues (audience characteristics) of each publication. The earlier you guess the publication, the more points you get – but be careful, if you guess incorrectly you'll get 0 points! \n\nThe winning team will get something totally amazing, like tickets to Hamilton or a puppy. This pub quiz is a great way to have some fun, get to know other attendees, and learn something about the people who consume the content we create.

Not very many great resources exist, testing can be a pain, and just figuring out where to start can leave you scratching your head.

As a result, if accessibility gets thought about at all, it’s often an afterthought. If you’re someone who needs an accessible site, you’re left wandering in an information wasteland.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way! Building accessible content and interfaces — even on tight deadlines — is completely doable. You just have to think about it from the beginning. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of basic accessibility principles, tools, and testing. We’ll then break into groups and look at those principles in the context of journalism — testing some apps, looking at alt text, debating the pros and cons of delivering alternative experiences and and dissecting data visualizations and sites in a way that will help you think about how usable the site really is.
