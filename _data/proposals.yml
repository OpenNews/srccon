        "description": "The Internet of Things is not a bunch of IFTTT recipes. IoT is an idea that a network of connected devices can inform and improve our lives. We've seen many news dispatches from the dystopian hellscape of consumer IoT with toys, cameras, and other compromised devices making us second guess if this is all just a horrific blunder. However, there are massive efficiencies being gained through industrial and agricultural uses of IoT. As we continue down the path of real-time tweaking of our reality based on data, journalists need to understand how commercial IoT is being used and how to more meaningful interpret data reported by government, non-government, and private-sector entities using IoT.",

This means we analyze data from afar and write anecdotal trend pieces without much understanding of the vast and diverse local populations that might be impacted or influencing some topic. Fear not! There are bunches of motivated and stoked people at the local level that want to find, process, and provide information to the public to help them be more informed. These civic hacktivists share an ethos with journalists. We should look to connect with local Code for America brigades to get more context at the local level until we actually achieve better geographic diversity in media.\n\nRebekah and Dave co-founded two Code for America brigades in Florida (Miami and Gainesville). Erie recently joined Code for America to help strengthen the network of brigades. This means they help connect hackers and activists with their local governments to find ways to make government work better for the people. Come and discuss tactics for connecting with local brigades to find data and better understand local issues, local people and local governments… since we know y’all don’t have people living there.",

        "description": "Working with code in organizations is a trade, involving craftsmanship and careful curation of content to build bold and clear narratives. Style guides and design patterns give us some frameworks for crafting simple, repeatable, and structured projects; likewise by committing to a pattern, we can forecast the utility of a project or interactive, and easily solicit contributions toward a more evolved and better-tested model for design. Still, as with documentation, these patterns can sometimes be forgotten, difficult to commit to, or lost in the tight timelines for interactive development and the driving need to introduce new and different interaction models. Let's collect a series of vetted design patterns and compose a quick reference for these guidelines based on themes; thereafter we can create a \"plain\" version that pulls from all references and might be worth incorporating into the exploratory planning stages of future interactives across newsrooms, disciplines, and projects. Maybe we can submit the output as an IRE tipsheet: https://www.ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/?q=newsrooms&page=2",
