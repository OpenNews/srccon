Maybe it's because there are no clear avenues for critique in the community (am I supposed to Tweet at you \"Hey, did you consider purple instead of grey?\"), but maybe it is because we are worried that saying something critical is the same as saying something *mean*. In this session, which will (hopefully) be co-facilitated by an instructor at the Pacific Northwest College of Art, let's go back to (art) school and learn how to think about and perform peer critiques. Then, let's test out our new skills on a few projects that you have made this year. And then, let's figure out how to keep it going after SRCCON and get better together through constructive critique and awesome, actionable feedback.",

In smaller organizations it can be even trickier as the new lonely coder must navigate these waters (somewhat) alone. For managers and new hires alike, we want to lead a session looking at how to make this process less painful. How can we integrate new team members faster?

It is frequently the case that data from our digital footprints is used to predict our behavior and make decisions about the choices available to us. This unprecedented capacity to collect and analyze data has brought along with it a troubling dismissiveness of user agency, participation, and ownership. Such systems assume that it is an acceptable by-product for their users to have no understanding of the decisions being made about them and no agency in that decision-making process. For the most part, the invisibilized nature of these decisions are seen as a feature, not a bug, of a good user experience. As we begin to use algorithmic decision-making in areas of our lives that are increasingly high-stakes, it is essential that we create and utilize processes that maintain user agency and understanding. In this session, participants will be imagining and designing user experiences that employ participatory algorithmic-decision making processes. The session will be open to folks from all experience levels.

You’ve read the books, listened to the management advice podcasts, maybe even participated in some leadership training. But much of the advice out there doesn’t account for the unique challenges you face as a journalism/tech manager when you are a woman, person of color, or in another underrepresented group. From overt dismissal to subtle yet insidious microaggressions, how do we succeed as leaders in an industry where the decision makers are still predominantly white and male?\n\nLet’s share advice and brainstorm specific tactics for handling the roadblocks faced by women, people of color, and other underrepresented folks who want to lead and make big things happen. Everyone is welcome to participate, but if you’re in a majority group, aim to listen A LOT more than you talk.",

But are you getting the most out of them? Did you know that you can use a built-in scripting language to mutate Google Apps in countless ways--turning it into a server, a scraper, or a mail alert system?\n\nIn this session, I'll walk through real Apps Script systems that we've built at the Times, including storing user-generated content for static apps, geocoding thousands of addresses, and parsing through scraped data. It won't be pretty, and it won't be perfect, but it'll add new utility to the tools you're already using--not to mention those magic words in a cash-starved newsroom: it's free!",

How are different newsrooms building, producing, and maintaining their apps and/or large, complex stories? Who's responsible for this kind of archiving and preservation work? And how do the methods of archiving shape the future of the story itself? This session will discuss a few case studies of both neglected and well-maintained projects (primarily in the context of reporting on large file dumps and data leaks) to explore potential guiding principles for maintenance-driven journalism.

Then you come to realize that the company has a lot going on, and the harder, grittier tasks that would foster your growth are only assigned to senior level employees. You are given problems that aren’t somewhat challenging, but not very impactful. You go through moments of panic, frustration, and loss. In the long run, how do you do to maintain your happiness and engagement?\n\nThis is a scenario that seems to be recurrent amongst junior employees at large companies, but this session is for anyone that has felt that their skills weren’t being fostered in the workplace. \nThe discussion would be roughly divided like so:\n- Are people making excuses, or are they genuinely being smothered by corporations for various reasons (culture, personality,  etc...)?  \n- What are some ways to get out of these unfulfilling situations, or avoid them altogether, at the individual scale? \n- Do you have ideas of what corporations could do to facilitate (and monitor) the growth of their junior (or any) employees?",

The goal of listening to audiences isn’t a new one and is highly valuable for producing powerful news presentations. Yet many media organizations aren’t utilizing user research today because of lack of funds, recording equipment, physical space and/or expert guidance. In lacking easy ways to gain insights into people's busy lives, news teams can become overly dependent on their own instincts. This results in unimaginative story presentations and tired templates that fail to engage existing and would­-be audiences.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. Let’s discuss and sketch what a user research toolkit for distributed news teams might look like. What combination of methods for listening and observation (including but not limited to interviews, surveys, usability testing and co-­design techniques) would help your own team’s efforts? How can we best enable people working across functions to run their own audience research? What would it take for newsrooms to adopt a more flexible take on the traditional usability lab? This session will involve a lot of creativity as well as real talk about organizational change and costs considerations.

Diversity drives growth and innovation, and a diverse workforce allows us to best serve our readers by speaking authentically about more experiences.\n\nWe are organizing this session to brainstorm and discuss on-the-ground techniques to support the hiring, retention and advancement of diverse talent in technology, with a focus on how to effect change at large organization outside of Silicon Valley.

If you’re on the tech side, you feel frustrated when you try to tell non-coders and business folks why it’s a priority. If you’re not on the tech side, you feel frustrated at hearing the phrase “tech debt” repeated over and over, without any apparent connection to your department’s priorities.\n\nIf we take a step back, we might find that debt isn't right metaphor for what we’re talking about. What we call \"tech debt\" is incurred not by individual debtors, but by organization-wide processes (or lack thereof). And unlike monetary debt, most tech debt can’t be paid off quickly, even if you have financial resources to throw at it. We need better ways to describe what tech debt is, how it builds up, and how to fix it, in terms that the whole company can understand.\n\nIn this session, I’ll talk about metaphors (such as home renovation) that have helped our newsroom unite in our success over considerable tech debt, and invite participants to share their own experiences of explaining or hearing about technical debt. By creating a campaign to explain tech debt effectively, participants will leave equipped to get organizational buy-in by making communication the first step of your technical debt plan.",

This internship could mean a shining opportunity, or it could mean realizing that they’re a heap of useless and don’t know anything. No pressure.\nFor mentors, they have jobs and projects and deadlines and bosses. They’re doing their best to keep up with editorial demands while staying current with the latest libraries and design trends. Then, every summer a heap of applications arrive on your desk, and they all look and sound the same. Eventually, the interns arrive and need to be on-boarded (not only with the org’s CMS, but also with the team’s development environment), brought up to speed on stories and ongoing projects, and given assignments all within a few days.
