As a group, or in small groups, we’ll talk about the things that most terrify us, and then work together to come up with solutions and ideas.",

Still, as with documentation, these patterns can sometimes be forgotten, difficult to commit to, or lost in the tight timelines for interactive development and the driving need to introduce new and different interaction models. Let's collect a series of vetted design patterns and compose a quick reference for these guidelines based on themes; thereafter we can create a \"plain\" version that pulls from all references and might be worth incorporating into the exploratory planning stages of future interactives across newsrooms, disciplines, and projects.
