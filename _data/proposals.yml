This session is aimed at people in management positions as well as individual contributors, aimed at soliciting a wide array of opinions and experiences in delivering good and bad feedback, tactics for approaching harder subjects, and sharing knowledge so we can all learn to be better.\n\nThe format would start with a framing question and a few examples of personal experiences where I had given or received feedback from colleagues. I also plan to solicit a few examples of experiences prior to the session to use as talking points to spark conversation among participants.",

And nerds: how can you better communicate to journalists, clients, or laypeople about the really important analyses you know they want or need to know about, if only you could formulate your thoughts in a comprehensible way? Most of us, from either side, know that Wikipedia at these critical moments has nothing to offer but cold betrayal sprinkled with greek characters and LaTeX. \nLike LaPlace said of probability theory, data science at its best is simply \"common sense reduced to calculation.\" But how do you get through the calculation bits and back to the common sense?\nAs consultants and educators, we (the organizers) spend a lot of time explaining complicated quantitative concepts to humans who vary in background, motivation, perspective, affinity, and attention span. We've often dreamed of a collaborative resource where the world of machine learning, data science, applied math, statistics, what have you, and et cetera, are made comprehensible through the communicative tools of example, origin, metaphor, analogy, pictures, diagrams, storytelling and good old patient ELI5. \nIn this session, we'll come armed with some curated examples from our experience, answer some pre-submitted questions, and (gulp) field live questions from attendees on the fly. Finally, we'll share draft concepts and designs for an open source home where this conversation can live and grow. With some buy-in, we (the organizers plus) can crack our knuckles and start coding up a knowledge repository where, through asking and answering, all interested parties can learn how to better communicate with each other, such that the common sense can be teased out of the mire of calculations in service of learning, sanity, and the greater good.",

Coding in direct response to current events requires fantastically rapid software engineering that usually moves much faster than the technology industry's other product development cycles. Documentation is thus often demoted even further than usual in order to allow for these tighter deadlines, but undocumented or poorly documented code isn't really useful to anyone beyond the original programmer, and bad documentation is often rightfully a catastrophic barrier to the process of open sourcing a project, which hurts everybody. Even if you don't ultimately intend to share your code, bad documentation means your own organization will find it more difficult to maintain – or, worse yet, to iterate on and reuse the next time it is needed for the next breaking story which has another tight deadline. This sucks! Let's try to help by discussing specific strategies for rapidly and effectively documenting source code in the publishing technology space, whether for internal use or eventual open source release, covering everything from the language used in Git commit messages and inline code comments to ticketing software and broader management perspectives.",

These projects and the challenges they face are not unique to media organizations. It turns out, the federal government is loaded with hobbled projects. In government, the failure that acted as the catalyst was healthcare.gov. After, the White House launched a new U.S. Digital Service and recruited some of the country's top digital minds to serve, to help transform government services.\n\nIt turns out, many of the problems we've all seen affecting large media organizations also affect large government agencies. As government has seen the same failures play out in dozens of projects, it means we're gaining a lot of experience in building effective digital services for citizens and federal employees.

Many are building their own tools and workarounds. Others are using off-the-shelf solutions but with significant customizations. While some organizations are trying to reinvent it, there are many outstanding questions, and many other organizations don't have the resources to solve it all by themselves. No current solution, whether a piece of software, a service, or a custom-built solution, adequately fills journalism's growing content management needs.

But there’s a major shift coming in how ads are sold, served, and measured, and it has huge implications for how news websites will be designed and built. If you work on a site that has ads, you should be getting ready for viewability.\n\nMost ads are sold at a price per thousand impressions, and traditionally impressions are counted as soon as the ad is inserted into the page. But the “viewable impression” is counted only after the ad enters the browser’s viewport. For some sites, this means that HALF of all ads served might never be seen by a reader or paid for by an advertiser.\n\nThis session will provide an overview of online advertising in general, and ad viewability in particular. I'll cover the technologies used to measure viewability and how it might impact the design and development of news sites. Finally, I’ll provide some ideas for how newsroom developers can adapt to viewability, use it to their advantage, and even borrow some concepts to improve the news apps you develop.",

They're meant for short attention spans and are often built to promote products for companies or recap an events. This design approach got me thinking: How could we as journalists adapt this idea to tell micro stories to our readers? Rather than write a full story or build an interactive graphic, we could fashion \"light apps\" that get the point across in a slick manner and then are never looked upon again. In this session, we'll take a look at some existing light apps and brainstorm story ideas that could work for the format.",

In this session, I propose that we discuss the design that works best for mobile from your experience, and we brainstorm cool features we would love to see. We will work to summarize best practices and great in-the-wild ideas. We will think this problem together and try to tackle it together.",

And they are spending millions to build or buy sophisticated CRM systems that track and link their customers through not just social media and online buying preferences but also through public records. But we also know how flawed the data collected by these CRM systems and LexisNexis can be. Public records are not necessarily clean data. Nor do they often tell full stories on their own.\n\nHaving access to good data within the right context is immensely valuable. That’s in part why we’ve seen data stores such as ProPublica’s and the Texas Tribune’s show such promise. As we consider revenue streams to support good journalism, data may be one of those that gives us the resources and the independence we need. \n\nLet’s talk about how to best monetize data responsibly, ethically and without sacrificing journalistic standards. Proposed topics for discussion include: \n\n* What datasets should newsrooms be collecting as a matter of course — what is valuable? How should we define “valuable”?\n\n* How should these datasets be published? How much fact-checking is the right amount of fact-checking, particularly with significantly large datasets? What standards (if there should be standards) need to be put in place re: ideas such as version control, auditing back to the source and linking people within datasets? \n\n* Should all data be published? What are our responsibilities in terms of protecting privacy? How might our decisions on what to publish affect open records laws — could we see a backlash and how much should concern over that factor into our decision-making on what to publish? (For example, whether or not home addresses can be released by government agencies has been a huge topic in Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth Court recently ruled that agencies can’t release home addresses under the Right-to-Know Law without informing each person that his/her address would be released and giving them a chance to contest it. But this ruling doesn’t seem to apply to the release of home addresses in the voter registration database. Yet. If we use the voter registration database to map voters, how granular do we want to be in what we publish? How might that decision affect the state’s ongoing debate about the openness of those records?) \n\n* Let’s also talk about how, technically, these data “libraries” could be built — how can this idea of monetizing data work practically and efficiently, especially for small to mid-sized newsrooms?",

Part of the workshop will be on the command-line, and part will be in the Flatsheet web application. You will need to install both the Dat command line-tool and the Flatsheet application on your own computer, and you will be able to do this at the start of the workshop (it only takes a couple of minutes).\n\nSome basic command-line experience (Mac, Linux or Windows) is necessary to get the most out of this workshop.\n\nMore about Dat and Flatsheet:\n\nDat (http://dat-data.com/) is an open source version control and data sharing tool for data sets. It comes with a command line tool called 'dat' that lets you do things like 'dat pull', 'dat diff', 'dat merge' and 'dat push'. The goal of dat is to let you automate your data workflows so you can share and consume changes to datasets with others easily.\n\nDat is funded by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and has a primary goal of being used by scientists to publish data for reproducible research and collaboration. It is currently in 'beta'.\n\nFlatsheet lets you edit data sets in realtime with your team. If you've used Google Spreadsheets with a library like Tabletop.js to create an ad-hoc mini-CMS, Flatsheet solves that problem more effectively, and is an open-source tool you can host on your own server. Flatsheet integrates with Dat, so you can use Dat to clone any sheet, edit locally, and push changes back to Flatsheet.\n\nFlatsheet recently received a grant from the Knight Prototype Fund, as well as a code sprint grant from OpenNews.

Boy, have we got something for you — Docker, an open platform for developers to build, ship, and run distributed applications. And what if we told you that you could get all those benefits AND it’s faster than virtual machines? Not possible, you say. But it is! You want bare-metal performance? That comes standard! But wait, there’s more! You need it to be repeatable? You got it! Docker also means less installation of endless requirements and dependencies per project. That’s a whole lotta simplification. In our session, we’ll go over how we use Docker in our workflow and get you ready to integrate it into your newsroom’s workflow. You can dip your toes in by phasing in Docker elements; it’s not an all-or-nothing platform. We’ll get you ready to run Docker on your laptop and make sure you understand key Docker concepts, including Dockerfiles, linking, publishing ports, and volumes. The concepts we’ll go over will be applicable to running containers in general, whether that’s using Docker, Rocket, or a similar tool. We’ll build on the syllabus found here: https://github.com/texastribune/docker-workshop, and we’ll also include a curated list of tutorials and other resources for you to keep learning. You can do it!",

Putting those same items on digital has essentially just been tagged onto the end of that process. But in many newsrooms this workflow doesn't work well for digital-only work, particularly when it involves data. \n\nWe’d like this session to be a work-group format with a goal to create the ideal workflow -- from idea germination to publication. This should include best practices for communication flows, deadlines, how/when items will be edited (for usability, clarity, style, grammar, spelling, etc), process for creating/sharing/discussing mockups, first drafts, etc. A very key piece should be who should be included in the process and when (and by “who” we want to identify skillsets, rather than specific job titles). Some of the questions that could be used as part of this discussion include: How and when should people (i.e. reporter, data wranglers, devs, editors, copy editors) get looped in? What are realistic time frames for getting a digital-only project completed (obviously dependant on the scope)? How should deadlines be used in this workflow? What skillsets are needed (this goes back to the “who” is involved piece) to ensure you’re producing high-quality digital product? \n\nWe’d like to split into three groups, each working on their own proposed workflows to address three different scenarios: 1) a digital product that accompanies an enterprise story that is weeks or months in the making, 2) a digital product that needs to be done quickly (either daily or short-term), either with or without a story\nand 3) a stand-alone digital-only product, such as a news app or tool which does not heavily feature a text component.\n\nWe realize many people attending the session come from organizations where there are a lot of road bumps that might need to be fixed before such a system could be put into place, but we don’t want to spend this session just talking about the problems. At the end of the session, we’ll combine the three groups to discuss the implementation piece. Who has had success? What worked, what didn't? How do you convince higher-ups that this should be a priority? How do you cut through the office politics?\n\nWe want to come up with an ideal workflow that can be used by newsrooms as a goal to achieve, since each newsroom will likely have its own unique problems to resolve before achieving it.",

What are some ways we can automate these errors out of existence?\n\nLet's get together, present some real world \"quality\" problems to work on, prototype, wireframe, and define algorithms, and then share our results.",

But there are lots of them, and only one or two of us. So how do you say no to good ideas, while keeping those good ideas flowing? How do you tell senior editors that you don’t have the resources when they want Snowfall? How do you determine which of the good ideas has the most value journalistically, and/or most potential for audience, social sharing or revenue? Doing this poorly leads to missed opportunities, time wasted on projects with no legs or shelf life, journalistic flaws, poor execution because of overbooking your time or unrealistic expectations — and burnout from long hours, nights and weekends. Doing it well strengthens our journalism, builds audience and reputation, opens new revenue opportunities and leads to even more good ideas.

But this ambition ignores the actual goal of programming, which is almost completely about making machines do mundane work. And it is counterproductive to learning how to program, which requires consistent practice as in every other form of literacy and art. \n \nSo this session will be about mundane programming. Programming not to be the next Zuckerberg, or to get a better job 3 months from now, but to make today or just the next ten minutes more enjoyable. Instead of focusing specifically on how to code, we'll expand upon the reasons of why we code (though seeing is often believing when it comes to code, so feel free to bring both ideas and Gists). And we'll trim the personal prerequisites of programming, which don't include being an entrepreneur, having a profitable idea, building a website, contributing to open source, or changing the world or your career. Programming can be learned, and done, with a willingness to learn and a wide variety of small problems to practice upon.",

Let's make a kite and go for a walk around a Minneapolis lake or two. (Note: this requires some wind. But fear not, if there is no wind the backup plan is to do (helium) ballon mapping instead. Still cheaper than a drone). After kite-flying we'll have a look at the photos, stitch them together, contribute it Open Street Map and talk about some cool kite mapping projects.\n\n(this workshop will work over two days, day 1 mapping (a couple of hours), day 2 do some stuff with computers)",
