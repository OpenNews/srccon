After playing some (adapted version of) D&D, we'll discuss examples of how others have used roleplaying to teach, which lessons lend themselves to roleplaying, and finally, create as a group a lesson plan for making your next class an adventure. \n\n<i>The unamended title of this session pitch is: The Dungeon Master's Guide to Teaching Journalism, 3rd Edition, Revised (v3.5)</i>",

Choosing tools and methods can be complex decisions, especially in the hip, constantly-changing front-end space.  Let's rap about the tools we use, or don't use, or  just thought about using, and all the things that go into those decisions.  Beginner or advanced, you will have something to share and will definitely learn a thing or two.\n\nSome potential sub-topics could be CSS processing (LESS/SASS), Javascript frameworks (Backbone/Angular/Ractive), icons (SVG/Font-icons), interface frameworks (Bootsrap/Foundation), dependency management (Require/Browserify), building (Gulp/Grunt), and so much more.",

Let’s face it: Over time, junk builds up, and you have section fronts that haven’t been updated in years. Or they have old styles. Or they aren’t organized the same way others are. Let’s talk about redesigns from a non-design perspective: dividing the labor, satisfying competing interests, identifying problems, using data to determine organization, retraining staff and applying consistent styles.",

        "description": "Many good ideas come out of journalists who are enthusiastic about their beats and the opportunity to capture large audiences. But there are lots of them, and only one or two of us. So how do you say no to good ideas, while keeping those good ideas flowing? How do you tell senior editors that you don’t have the resources when they want Snowfall? How do you determine which of the good ideas has the most value journalistically, and/or most potential for audience, social sharing or revenue? Doing this poorly leads to missed opportunities, time wasted on projects with no legs or shelf life, journalistic flaws, poor execution because of overbooking your time or unrealistic expectations — and burnout from long hours, nights and weekends. Doing it well strengthens our journalism, builds audience and reputation, opens new revenue opportunities and leads to even more good ideas. Successes build on themselves; failures devalue our potential.",

Let's set aside imposter syndrome as quick as we can and discuss actively (re)shaping crummy projects, layered feedback and plateaued feelings into active learnings.  Part of that is intentionally *unlearning* habits — both skill and attitudes that stick.  Another facet is accommodating how we each learn differently — how to judge what stuff can percolate and what needs immediate patching.",

        "description": "Programming creates so many technical and creative inventions that it's natural for aspiring programmers to dream of big projects in the cloud. But this ambition ignores the actual goal of programming, which is almost completely about making machines do mundane work. And it is counterproductive to learning how to program, which requires consistent practice as in every other form of literacy and art. \n \nSo this session will be about mundane programming. Programming not to be the next Zuckerberg, or to get a better job 3 months from now, but to make today or just the next ten minutes more enjoyable. Instead of focusing specifically on how to code, we'll expand upon the reasons of why we code (though seeing is often believing when it comes to code, so feel free to bring both ideas and Gists). And we'll trim the personal prerequisites of programming, which don't include being an entrepreneur, having a profitable idea, building a website, contributing to open source, or changing the world or your career. Programming can be learned, and done, with a willingness to learn and a wide variety of small problems to practice upon.",

Sure, all the cool kids are using drones. But when journalists get arrested for trespassing when they are using their shiny + easy to spot drone to film correctional facilities, their colleague flying a kite is less likely to be stopped (what, I'm just flying my kite?). Let's make a kite and go for a walk around a Minneapolis lake or two. (Note: this requires some wind. But fear not, if there is no wind the backup plan is to do (helium) ballon mapping instead. Still cheaper than a drone). After kite-flying we'll have a look at the photos, stitch them together, contribute it Open Street Map and talk about some cool kite mapping projects.\n\n(this workshop will work over two days, day 1 mapping (a couple of hours), day 2 do some stuff with computers)",
