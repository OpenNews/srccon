Good READMEs couple well with other all-caps files like LICENSES, CONTRIBUTOR.md, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md files, but sometimes the standards for what to include, how to design, and where to feature your README aren't explicit to new developers or new-to-open-source programmers. Further, projects who bring some special character to their README benefit from attracting more users, earning more publicity and cross-postings, and can be lauded as \"cool\" even though the actually base project or tech functionality is buggy. That said, even if your tech is 110% awesome, you can lose people if your README, compile instructions, or general repository details are awkward or obscure. This is a session about github netiquette, README design, and repository architecture that engages your chosen community in collaboration and contribution; we'll showcase some cool hacks for advanced README authorship as well as how to create a README that suit your project and prospective contributors alike.",

I believe we can form mentor-mentee relationships and come up with ways to teach small-paper journalists to think about data and code, even if it's done remotely (because the internet!). Throughout this session, I hope to brainstorm different ways to forge connections with other journalists; for instance, if you're based in New York City, this would be a great time to get in touch with fellow journalists in Buffalo and Schenectady.

Beliefs will influence how people feel about the world and how to act in it. So how do we want these beliefs to be? And which kind of journalism would be needed to achieve them? We'll start high-level and talk about (conflicting) goals in journalism and its responsibility in our society. With this discussion in mind, we go downwards on the ladder of abstraction and explore specific journalistic tools and principles in smaller groups. Examples of the directions these discussions could take are \"immersive journalism with VR / empathy building vs. a neutral stance\", \"exemplification / stories vs. stats / 'reality' / data vis\" and \"investigative journalism / journalism as activism vs. journalism as unbiased observer\".

However, we now face a growing array of other ways to distribute our content to readers using mobile devices: native iOS and Android apps, AMP, Facebook Instant, Apple News, and more. This session will dive into the array of questions we face in confronting the restrictions these environments place on interactives and storytelling. It will give us a chance swap strategies for building code that works great (or at least works) on these platforms, and a space to talk about navigating the business and editorial pressure to use them over traditional responsive mobile experiences.",

In a newsroom setting, writing and building on deadline and with an eye toward long-term maintenance is a tricky balance. Neglecting it can lead to linkrot, deprecated apps, and a lazy reliance on SEO to define the public record; overemphasizing it may induce existential paralysis. How are different newsrooms building, producing, and maintaining their apps and/or large, complex stories? Who's responsible for this kind of archiving and preservation work? And how do the methods of archiving shape the future of the story itself? This session will discuss a few case studies of both neglected and well-maintained projects (primarily in the context of reporting on large file dumps and data leaks) to explore potential guiding principles for maintenance-driven journalism. Participants are encouraged to come prepared to share examples of broken or well-maintained news apps or instances of what they consider successes or failures in journalism maintenance.",

The goal of listening to audiences isn’t a new one and is highly valuable for producing powerful news presentations. Yet many media organizations aren’t utilizing user research today because of lack of funds, recording equipment, physical space and/or expert guidance. In lacking easy ways to gain insights into people's busy lives, news teams can become overly dependent on their own instincts. This results in unimaginative story presentations and tired templates that fail to engage existing and would­-be audiences.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. Let’s discuss and sketch what a user research toolkit for distributed news teams might look like. What combination of methods for listening and observation (including but not limited to interviews, surveys, usability testing and co-­design techniques) would help your own team’s efforts? How can we best enable people working across functions to run their own audience research? What would it take for newsrooms to adopt a more flexible take on the traditional usability lab? This session will involve a lot of creativity as well as real talk about organizational change and costs considerations. Come join as we democratize user experience research access to make improvements for reader, viewer and listener benefit.",

It can be demoralizing when senior executives don't prioritize diversity as an issue and the task of changing the culture at a company can feel overwhelming. These challenges are especially acute at companies that have not historically considered themselves tech companies, because the senior leadership is often not as aware of the barriers and biases against women in technical roles.\n\nAs we continue to expand the technology group at The New York Times, we are actively invested in diversity and inclusion. We firmly believe that our workforce should reflect our audience, which is global and diverse. Diversity drives growth and innovation, and a diverse workforce allows us to best serve our readers by speaking authentically about more experiences.\n\nWe are organizing this session to brainstorm and discuss on-the-ground techniques to support the hiring, retention and advancement of diverse talent in technology, with a focus on how to effect change at large organization outside of Silicon Valley.

If you’re on the tech side, you feel frustrated when you try to tell non-coders and business folks why it’s a priority. If you’re not on the tech side, you feel frustrated at hearing the phrase “tech debt” repeated over and over, without any apparent connection to your department’s priorities.\n\nIf we take a step back, we might find that debt isn't right metaphor for what we’re talking about. What we call \"tech debt\" is incurred not by individual debtors, but by organization-wide processes (or lack thereof). And unlike monetary debt, most tech debt can’t be paid off quickly, even if you have financial resources to throw at it. We need better ways to describe what tech debt is, how it builds up, and how to fix it, in terms that the whole company can understand.\n\nIn this session, I’ll talk about metaphors (such as home renovation) that have helped our newsroom unite in our success over considerable tech debt, and invite participants to share their own experiences of explaining or hearing about technical debt. By creating a campaign to explain tech debt effectively, participants will leave equipped to get organizational buy-in by making communication the first step of your technical debt plan.",

For interns, they’re faced with crippling imposter syndrome on top of whatever college obligations they have, plus the quest for a job. They see listings mention things like D3, Angular and Django and freeze with uncertainty. Most students are lucky if they’ve had a class mention even one of those things. This internship could mean a shining opportunity, or it could mean realizing that they’re a heap of useless and don’t know anything. No pressure.\nFor mentors, they have jobs and projects and deadlines and bosses. They’re doing their best to keep up with editorial demands while staying current with the latest libraries and design trends. Then, every summer a heap of applications arrive on your desk, and they all look and sound the same. Eventually, the interns arrive and need to be on-boarded (not only with the org’s CMS, but also with the team’s development environment), brought up to speed on stories and ongoing projects, and given assignments all within a few days. Plus if they screw up, it’s on you.\nHow can we improve our internship programs and make it a little easier on both sides? How can we increase diversity and be more realistic with our technical expectations? Let’s talk about how to make this better from application to potential hires.",
