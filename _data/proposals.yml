The goal of listening to audiences isn’t a new one and is highly valuable for producing powerful news presentations. Yet many media organizations aren’t utilizing user research today because of lack of funds, recording equipment, physical space and/or expert guidance. In lacking easy ways to gain insights into people's busy lives, news teams can become overly dependent on their own instincts. This results in unimaginative story presentations and tired templates that fail to engage existing and would­-be audiences.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. Let’s discuss and sketch what a user research toolkit for distributed news teams might look like. What combination of methods for listening and observation (including but not limited to interviews, surveys, usability testing and co-­design techniques) would help your own team’s efforts? How can we best enable people working across functions to run their own audience research? What would it take for newsrooms to adopt a more flexible take on the traditional usability lab? This session will involve a lot of creativity as well as real talk about organizational change and costs considerations. Come join as we democratize user experience research access to make improvements for reader, viewer and listener benefit.",

It can be demoralizing when senior executives don't prioritize diversity as an issue and the task of changing the culture at a company can feel overwhelming.

We firmly believe that our workforce should reflect our audience, which is global and diverse. Diversity drives growth and innovation, and a diverse workforce allows us to best serve our readers by speaking authentically about more experiences.\n\nWe are organizing this session to brainstorm and discuss on-the-ground techniques to support the hiring, retention and advancement of diverse talent in technology, with a focus on how to effect change at large organization outside of Silicon Valley.

If you’re on the tech side, you feel frustrated when you try to tell non-coders and business folks why it’s a priority. If you’re not on the tech side, you feel frustrated at hearing the phrase “tech debt” repeated over and over, without any apparent connection to your department’s priorities.\n\nIf we take a step back, we might find that debt isn't right metaphor for what we’re talking about. What we call \"tech debt\" is incurred not by individual debtors, but by organization-wide processes (or lack thereof). And unlike monetary debt, most tech debt can’t be paid off quickly, even if you have financial resources to throw at it. We need better ways to describe what tech debt is, how it builds up, and how to fix it, in terms that the whole company can understand.\n\nIn this session, I’ll talk about metaphors (such as home renovation) that have helped our newsroom unite in our success over considerable tech debt, and invite participants to share their own experiences of explaining or hearing about technical debt. By creating a campaign to explain tech debt effectively, participants will leave equipped to get organizational buy-in by making communication the first step of your technical debt plan.",

They see listings mention things like D3, Angular and Django and freeze with uncertainty. Most students are lucky if they’ve had a class mention even one of those things. This internship could mean a shining opportunity, or it could mean realizing that they’re a heap of useless and don’t know anything. No pressure.\nFor mentors, they have jobs and projects and deadlines and bosses. They’re doing their best to keep up with editorial demands while staying current with the latest libraries and design trends. Then, every summer a heap of applications arrive on your desk, and they all look and sound the same. Eventually, the interns arrive and need to be on-boarded (not only with the org’s CMS, but also with the team’s development environment), brought up to speed on stories and ongoing projects, and given assignments all within a few days.
