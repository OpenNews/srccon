In this session, we’ll have a structured discussion facilitated by a tech director who built a whole CMS from scratch; a tech director who specializes in shipping software for teams of 0-1; and a tech director who inherited several years of tech debt on a custom-built CMS. We’ll share our experiences and talk about strategies for making the difficult calls -- usually, “to build or not to build?” -- that small teams inevitably face, as well as about how to make responsible, forward-looking choices regarding where to focus your code resources. We hope you'll learn how to avoid conjuring the Ghost of Tech Directors Future, even as you experiment and iterate in productive ways!",

Journalism’s objectivity ethos has journalists striving to report on facts (and not their personal attitude toward facts), with fairness and accuracy. \n\nWith newsrooms embracing new skill sets and welcoming more collaboration between people with a variety of professional backgrounds, different practices and traditions collide. Where is the line between designing for an audience and pandering to that audience? \n\nIn this session we explore user-centered design’s fit in the newsroom and the processes of reporting, and how characterizing the audience for a story shapes decisions about what, how when and where a story is told.",

But writing the docs is still an afterthought for a lot of developers, something to check off a list at the last minute before moving on. The end result is a lot of wasted potential, great tools that put off potential users because nobody can figure out how they work.\n\nIn this session, we'll discuss patterns of effective documentation and our own experiences as both readers and writers. How do we balance readability and precision? How do we write docs that serve both beginners and experts? How do we choose good examples? How do we make writing the docs a first-class citizen of any project, something that feels integral and not like extra homework? When we're reading docs, what makes things click and what makes us give up? Finally, we'll split up into groups and break out the red pens for close readings of documentation from a selection of popular libraries, and maybe even make some pull requests with our edits.",

Putting those same items on digital has essentially just been tagged onto the end of that process. But in many newsrooms this workflow doesn't work well for digital-only work, particularly when it involves data. \n\nWe’d like this session to be a work-group format with a goal to create the ideal workflow -- from idea germination to publication. This should include best practices for communication flows, deadlines, how/when items will be edited (for usability, clarity, style, grammar, spelling, etc), process for creating/sharing/discussing mockups, first drafts, etc. A very key piece should be who should be included in the process and when (and by “who” we want to identify skillsets, rather than specific job titles). Some of the questions that could be used as part of this discussion include: How and when should people (i.e. reporter, data wranglers, devs, editors, copy editors) get looped in? What are realistic time frames for getting a digital-only project completed (obviously dependant on the scope)? How should deadlines be used in this workflow? What skillsets are needed (this goes back to the “who” is involved piece) to ensure you’re producing high-quality digital product? \n\nWe’d like to split into three groups, each working on their own proposed workflows to address three different scenarios: 1) a digital product that accompanies an enterprise story that is weeks or months in the making, 2) a digital product that needs to be done quickly (either daily or short-term), either with or without a story\nand 3) a stand-alone digital-only product, such as a news app or tool which does not heavily feature a text component.\n\nWe realize many people attending the session come from organizations where there are a lot of road bumps that might need to be fixed before such a system could be put into place, but we don’t want to spend this session just talking about the problems. At the end of the session, we’ll combine the three groups to discuss the implementation piece. Who has had success? What worked, what didn't? How do you convince higher-ups that this should be a priority? How do you cut through the office politics?\n\nWe want to come up with an ideal workflow that can be used by newsrooms as a goal to achieve, since each newsroom will likely have its own unique problems to resolve before achieving it.",

Let's make a kite and go for a walk around a Minneapolis lake or two. (Note: this requires some wind. But fear not, if there is no wind the backup plan is to do (helium) ballon mapping instead. Still cheaper than a drone). After kite-flying we'll have a look at the photos, stitch them together, contribute it Open Street Map and talk about some cool kite mapping projects.\n\n(this workshop will work over two days, day 1 mapping (a couple of hours), day 2 do some stuff with computers)",

It's something Brian Krebs has written about a number of times and it made me wonder if reporters and sources are fully prepared to face challenges like trumped up charges based on forged evidence given to police, financial fraud etc...\n\nIn this session, I'd like to discuss methods for protecting yourself and your family both at home and abroad.",

This session will look at how some journalists have used machine learning and in what situations it's best and in what situations it should be avoided.",
