Additionally, we are responsible for using statistical techniques appropriately and describing them accurately.

I (and others) ended up helping them walk through the security disclosure process, helped draft messages intended to encourage users to upgrade, and poked people in the community.  There are individual things that folks who produce software for others can do to make this process easier for themselves & users, but also there are things that we should be doing as users to make sure we're prepared to upgrade when flaws are announced, and also, how to lend a hand when things are going wrong.

Datasette also provides a JSON+SQL API that allows developers to quickly build apps and visualizations on top of that data.\n\nThis will be a hands-on tutorial.

So let's get together and chat about how we can keep our heads above water while traversing a unique set of problems: from taking additional care to understand and report on issues that we probably haven’t grown up around, to working extra hard to find and land a job that sponsors a visa, and to dealing with entirely new identities.\nFor the allies: We know you care, we know you want to be supportive, but may not always know how. Join us so you can understand and support us in our struggles that we do not often feel like talking about. \nIn this two-part session, we will discuss how to navigate the (perhaps steep) learning curve of surviving and thriving in a culture that may be utterly unfamiliar, and then collectively devise and document strategies to better support immigrant journalists.",

Well, your days of worrying about front-end design could soon be over. Slack's suite of API's are vast and the documentation is one of the best of any API out there. In this session, I'll quickly demo most of the different methods of interaction available with Slack's APIs. We'll build a simple graphics request form together as a group. When that's finished, we'll brainstorm ideas for other newsroom tools and discuss how our front-end needs could be met by one or more of the methods we've seen so far. We'll be using Flask to do it, so basic Flask and Python knowledge will be required.\n\nSlack has a number of features you might need from a front-end design already included. Unprompted function calls? Slack has slash commands. Do they support arguments? You bet they do. Filling out forms? Slack's got that too. Giving personal user feedback when a script runs? Ephemeral messages make sure that only a single user can see the notification without ever having to leave the channel. Learn about all these and more in the session.\n\nWe'll use [this sandbox Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/srccon2018frontend/shared_invite/enQtMzg3ODM3NjIyMTAxLWVkZWI4NGFkYzRlNmZiMGU0N2U4NjBmMmY0Zjg1NjRmNGFiNDdkY2E2NDczMjA3ODA4YTk4ZTNiYzI1MDk4YmU) during the session, so feel free to go ahead and join!",
