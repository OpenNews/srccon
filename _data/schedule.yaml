It's a part of our journalistic economy, as the money and power in journalism is focused in just a few geographic locations--but it can also be damaging to local communities, and it can lead to misrepresentation, distrust and resentment. Often, national journalists appear in a community in times of trauma and elections, and report stories with insufficient context, while local journalists struggle to access equivalent resources for necessary ongoing reporting. This session will explore our collective experiences with parachute journalism as both insiders and outsiders to a community, in order to produce good ideas about how to do harm reduction, increase accountability, and shift power dynamics. We'll ask: Are there situations where it's better if this story just doesn't get told? How do we evaluate that? What can national media outlets and freelancers do to connect and collaborate with local journalists and local communities? What are the ethics of accountable partnerships? In what ways do local and regional/national media needs differ, and how can journalists collaborate to produce stories that better address the needs of all involved? All of this will be driving at a larger question: What does justice and accountability look like in the practice of journalism? ",

Typically it starts with the candidates and what they have to do to win, rather than the voters and what they need to participate. We should flip that.  \n\nIf we let the needs of community members drive the design of our election coverage, it would look dramatically different – and be dramatically better for our democratic process and social cohesion, we think. Bonus: those community members will be pretty grateful to you for unsexy coverage like explaining what a circuit court judge does. At a time when we’re pivoting to reader revenue, this public service journalism model is not just good karma – it should be seen as mission critical. \n\nWe’ll explore the “jobs to be done” in election reporting, how to ask questions that will give you a deeper understanding of voters’ information needs, the tools at our disposal to do that, and the ways that newsrooms can ensure they have enough feedback from actual voters to resist the siren call of the latest campaign gaffe or poll results.",

From the tech task force that turned into a team designated with making our site more accessible, to the internal panel on employees with disabilities that turned into an employee resource group the disabled community and their allies at the times are standing up and taking space. \n\nDuring this session we will examine how the disability community is represented in newsrooms and institutions, discuss what has been done, and set a framework for how to take action now. We will work together to figure out what ally-ship looks like and what it means for diversity initiatives to include people with disabilities, and how they miss the mark when they don’t -- both for employees and our coverage.

As part of a documentary project about a culturally diverse, low-income community, we recently invited residents to map their neighborhood — not online, but with paper and pens at in-person gatherings. We not only generated unique data, but also stories and context we never would have heard if we hadn’t met people where they lived. \n\nMore and more, journalists are experimenting with community engagement practices to accurately reflect and represent people’s lived experiences. We can do the same by taking an analog approach to creating data, including our community in the stories we tell about them. This helps verify the data by collecting it ourselves and having subject matter experts (your community!) vet it along the way. It also makes our reporting process more transparent and creates a group of people invested in our work. \n\nWe’ll share what we did and what we learned in our neighborhood mapping experiments, and invite a discussion on other ways to weave community engagement into data reporting. Our goal: draft a starter kit of ideas for doing data journalism IRL that you can take back to your newsroom.",

Are there lessons from screenwriting we can use to write engaging, data-driven stories, so we don’t end up with an info dump? Let’s find out together.\n\nIn this session, we’ll participate in a writers’ room to discuss how screenwriters use different strategies to jam-pack information into scenes while building a narrative and keeping pace.

For the first time in decades, the mayor's office was up for grabs with no incumbent and no heir apparent to the 5th floor of City Hall. Meanwhile, the clerk, treasurer and entire 50-seat City Council were up for election. Competition was fierce.\n\nSmall newsrooms faced the daunting task of covering all of these races. More than 200 candidates were running for local office -- including more than a dozen for mayor -- from complete unknowns to career pols. All of this was taking place in a news environment where media often struggles to engage voters and help them make informed decisions.\n\nWith these challenges in mind, a group of five local independent newsrooms decided to pool their resources and work together to create a one-stop resource to serve voters. In a matter of days, the Chi.vote Collaborative was founded, launching a website with candidate profiles, articles, voter resources and other information. The collaborative grew to 10 partners and traffic to the website surged heading into the February election and eventual April runoff. We literally built the car as we drove it, rolling out new features as fast as we could develop them.

Our newsroom might have to cover a traumatic event on a larger scale - a mass shooting, a devastating brush fire, hurricane or tornado. We take care to tell the stories of those affected, to make sure their voices and their grief are heard. But we also need to take care of ourselves and our colleagues in these moments. What should you be looking for to make sure you're protected and feel empowered to speak up for yourself when you don't feel comfortable or need help?

If we knew something needed to happen to make things better, could we identify a few levers to pull that’d make that something more likely? Would we frame the story differently? Share the data openly? Talk to different sources? And how do we do all of this without going too far, without crossing into advocacy journalism? Now more than ever, with more nonprofit newsrooms forming, more for-profit newsrooms turning to consumer revenue (on the sales pitch that journalism matters) and trust at a crisis point, we need to measure and show why our work matters.
