But there are lots of them, and only one or two of us. So how do you say no to good ideas, while keeping those good ideas flowing? How do you tell senior editors that you don’t have the resources when they want Snowfall? How do you determine which of the good ideas has the most value journalistically, and/or most potential for audience, social sharing or revenue? Doing this poorly leads to missed opportunities, time wasted on projects with no legs or shelf life, journalistic flaws, poor execution because of overbooking your time or unrealistic expectations — and burnout from long hours, nights and weekends. Doing it well strengthens our journalism, builds audience and reputation, opens new revenue opportunities and leads to even more good ideas. Successes build on themselves; failures devalue our potential.

Part of the workshop will be on the command-line, and part will be in the Flatsheet web application. You will need to install both the Dat command line-tool and the Flatsheet application on your own computer, and you will be able to do this at the start of the workshop (it only takes a couple of minutes).\n\nSome basic command-line experience (Mac, Linux or Windows) is necessary to get the most out of this workshop.\n\nMore about Dat and Flatsheet:\n\nDat (http://dat-data.com/) is an open source version control and data sharing tool for data sets. It comes with a command line tool called 'dat' that lets you do things like 'dat pull', 'dat diff', 'dat merge' and 'dat push'. The goal of dat is to let you automate your data workflows so you can share and consume changes to datasets with others easily.\n\nDat is funded by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and has a primary goal of being used by scientists to publish data for reproducible research and collaboration. It is currently in 'beta'.\n\nFlatsheet lets you edit data sets in realtime with your team. If you've used Google Spreadsheets with a library like Tabletop.js to create an ad-hoc mini-CMS, Flatsheet solves that problem more effectively, and is an open-source tool you can host on your own server. Flatsheet integrates with Dat, so you can use Dat to clone any sheet, edit locally, and push changes back to Flatsheet.\n\nFlatsheet recently received a grant from the Knight Prototype Fund, as well as a code sprint grant from OpenNews.

Thinking about “culture,” precisely and vigorously, comes in especially handy when your team needs to onboard junior members, or when there’s a on-the job learning happening (which is, let’s admit it, all the freaking time). \n\nUsing techniques and advice from an industry that is all about making communication and relationships healthier, we’ll work together in this interactive workshop to create better frameworks for how we give and receive feedback. Participants will leave with actionable strategies for how to make space for criticism on their teams, how to wrangle all the egos, and simple ways we can encourage and support each other as we build things every day.",

Often our efforts focus on a disability or impairment we are trying to accommodate. We can approach these challenges progressively – letting the capabilities of the hardware and software accessing our content be our guide. Sometimes accessibility isn’t just a nice-to-have – it’s required by law. When's the last time you tried navigating your site with just a keyboard? At 200% zoom? With a Wiimote? As Anne Gibson says in her A List Apart piece \"Reframing Accessibility on the Web,\" accessibility should not be just about determining \"your audience and building to their needs\" – accessibility should be a \"trait of the website itself,” an extension of the user experience. We'll chat about how we approach accessibility, share our mutual experiences, touch on common misconceptions and look into techniques to encourage mindfulness as we plan and build our projects going forward.\n\nIf you have a copy of your current accessibility guidelines, or anything that documents your newsroom’s process, please bring them with you!",

Putting those same items on digital has essentially just been tagged onto the end of that process. But in many newsrooms this workflow doesn't work well for digital-only work, particularly when it involves data. We’d like this session to be a work-group format with a goal to create the ideal workflow -- from idea germination to publication. This should include best practices for communication flows, deadlines, how/when items will be edited (for usability, clarity, style, grammar, spelling, etc), process for creating/sharing/discussing mockups, first drafts, etc. A very key piece should be who should be included in the process and when (and by “who” we want to identify skillsets, rather than specific job titles). We’d like to split into three groups, each working on their own proposed workflows to address three different scenarios: 1) a digital product that accompanies an enterprise story that is weeks or months in the making, 2) a digital product that needs to be done quickly (either daily or short-term), either with or without a story and 3) a stand-alone digital-only product, such as a news app or tool which does not heavily feature a text component. At the end of the session, we’ll combine the three groups to discuss implementation.  We want to come up with an ideal workflow that can be used by newsrooms as a goal to achieve, since each newsroom will likely have its own unique problems to resolve before achieving it.",

        "description": "Many media organizations have had giant, monolithic software and IT projects that stretched on for years. Some were somewhat successful; many were written off. Some are still ongoing.\n\nSome organizations have used these failures to their advantage, leveraging them to create new teams within the newsroom, avoid existing IT structures, merge print and web operations, and the like. These projects and the challenges they face are not unique to media organizations. It turns out, the federal government is loaded with hobbled projects. In government, the failure that acted as the catalyst was healthcare.gov. After, the White House launched a new U.S. Digital Service and recruited some of the country's top digital minds to serve, to help transform government services.\n\nIt turns out, many of the problems we've all seen affecting large media organizations also affect large government agencies. As government has seen the same failures play out in dozens of projects, it means we're gaining a lot of experience in building effective digital services for citizens and federal employees. (Media organizations also need to build effective services for two constituencies -- its staff and its readers. ) For existing projects, we're getting really good at working through a series of plays to rescue them, and set teams and projects back on track.\n\nThis session will present what's been learned from the first year of the U.S. Digital Service, and how these lessons can be applied to building effective digital tools for writers and readers alike. We can discuss struggling projects at media organizations (you know, hypothetical struggling projects) and dream up how they might be rescued.",

Based at times on what simply seems worth remembering during the life of a story or, at others, on strict guidelines of what passes the \"impact bar.\" Over the past two years, we conceived of and constructed NewsLynx (http://newslynx.org) to address two needs: first, as an attempt to understand how and through what processes news organizations large and small are currently approaching the \"impact problem\" and second, if we could develop a better way — through building an open-source platform— to help those newsrooms capture the qualitative and quantitive impact of their work.\n\nComing two weeks after the official public release of NewsLynx, this session will serve as the first opportunity for journalists, editors, and open-source hackers to work with the project's creators to install, configure, and extend the platform in their newsroom. We'll discuss the successes and failures we encountered throughout our beta test with six non-profit newsrooms and brainstorm potential means of extending the platform moving forward. If all goes well, we'll help technically-inclinded audience members actually deploy an instance of NewsLynx.\n\nIf you're interested in getting NewsLynx installed on your local machine, please have Vagrant and Ansible installed. Alternatively, if you don't want to run NewsLynx in a VM, have Redis, Postgres 9.3, Python 2.7.6, Node, NPM, and Git already installed. If you'd like to deploy NewsLynx in the cloud, please come with AWS credentials. People interested in Twitter, Facebook, and/or Google Analytics integrations should already have applications registered for these services and have their access tokens handy (see http://dev.twitter.com/, http://developers.facebook.com, and https://developers.google.com/, respectively). If you just want to learn about the platform, come with ideas on how to measure impact and examples of the tools and processes you're currently using in your Newsroom.",

The plan is to find and survey the people who code, crunch data, design interactive tools, present journalism, or manage people who do these things, in and around newsrooms. The process has just begun. We don’t even know the best questions to ask -- and that’s where SRCCON comes in. What do you need to know about our community?
