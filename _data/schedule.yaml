It's a part of our journalistic economy, as the money and power in journalism is focused in just a few geographic locations--but it can also be damaging to local communities, and it can lead to misrepresentation, distrust and resentment. Often, national journalists appear in a community in times of trauma and elections, and report stories with insufficient context, while local journalists struggle to access equivalent resources for necessary ongoing reporting. This session will explore our collective experiences with parachute journalism as both insiders and outsiders to a community, in order to produce good ideas about how to do harm reduction, increase accountability, and shift power dynamics. We'll ask: Are there situations where it's better if this story just doesn't get told? How do we evaluate that? What can national media outlets and freelancers do to connect and collaborate with local journalists and local communities? What are the ethics of accountable partnerships? In what ways do local and regional/national media needs differ, and how can journalists collaborate to produce stories that better address the needs of all involved? All of this will be driving at a larger question: What does justice and accountability look like in the practice of journalism? ",

We should flip that.  \n\nIf we let the needs of community members drive the design of our election coverage, it would look dramatically different – and be dramatically better for our democratic process and social cohesion, we think. Bonus: those community members will be pretty grateful to you for unsexy coverage like explaining what a circuit court judge does. At a time when we’re pivoting to reader revenue, this public service journalism model is not just good karma – it should be seen as mission critical. \n\nWe’ll explore the “jobs to be done” in election reporting, how to ask questions that will give you a deeper understanding of voters’ information needs, the tools at our disposal to do that, and the ways that newsrooms can ensure they have enough feedback from actual voters to resist the siren call of the latest campaign gaffe or poll results.",

In doing so, we'd also communicate how complex systems have a degree of impermanence and how this contributes to outages.

Explore demos, ask lots of questions, and share feedback with these seven awesome projects:\n\n**The Accountability Project**  \n[Project info](https://www.publicaccountability.org/)  \nThis project brings together national and state data from a variety of sources – including campaign finance, nonprofits and voter registration – to help journalists search across multiple datasets from one search.\n\n**Associated Press Data Distributions & Datakit**\n[Project info](https://www.ap.org/en-us/formats/data-journalism)\nThe Data Distributions program provides clean, documented, and analyzed data to help tell local stories on topics ranging from census tract-level life expectancy to segregation in local schools to farm subsidies offsetting the impacts of Chinese tariffs. Distributions are available to all AP members for a small annual fee and are available to non-AP members—and even research groups at times—through commercial arrangements. The AP will also provide a sneak peek into a data project management tool we’ll be fully open-sourcing in September: Datakit creates a templated project structure in either R or Python, syncs data to S3, and pushes code to Github or Gitlab.\n\n**The Coral Project**  \n[Project info](https://coral.voxmedia.com)  \nThe Coral Project brings journalists and the communities they serve closer together through open-source tools and strategies. Our goals are: to increase public trust in journalism, to improve the diversity of voices and experiences in reporting, to make journalism stronger by making it more relevant to people’s lives, and to create safer, more productive online dialog. Because journalism needs everyone. For SRCCON, we'll be showing an exclusive preview of v5 – our complete rewrite of the Coral code and UX – out later this year.\n\n**Big Local News**  \nBig Local News collects local data to uncover regional or national patterns for accountability stories with big impact. We pursue hard-to-obtain data kept in disparate formats by multiple jurisdictions. Big Local News also works with newsrooms to archive their data. We are building a platform to help journalists collaborate and share data. It will be integrated with specialized tools and connect with the Stanford Digital Repository so data and methodologies can be archived for others to use and expand upon. \n\n**Immersive storytelling with AR/VR**  \nImmersive storytelling is a way to engage readers in a story. Using VR, AR, and gaming technologies we will show you how we’ve used it at the Los Angeles Times and how you can bring it to your newsroom - even if you don’t know how to code.\n\n**Medill Local News Initiative**  \n[Project info](https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu)  \nWith local journalism in crisis, Northwestern University has assembled a team of experts in digital innovation, audience understanding and business strategy. The goal: reinvent the relationship between news organizations and audiences to elevate enterprises that empower citizens.\n\n**MuckRock Assignments**  \n[Project info](https://www.muckrock.com/assignment/)  \nWant to turn endless PDFs into beautiful spreadsheets? Looking for a new way to get your audience to help scale your reporting capacity? MuckRock's Assignments tool lets you crowdsource analysis of PDFs, social media posts, and other data types, while offering new ways to engage and follow up with your readers.\n\n**Workbench**  \n[Project info](https://workbenchdata.com/)  \nWorkbench brings all your data tools into one simple place, in your browser. It makes it easy to collect, scrape, transform and analyze data without code, automate and monitor tasks, and share reproducible step-by-step workflows along with dashboards and APIs.",

This may be an uncomfortable discussion for some in the room. We ask that participants come ready to be vulnerable and prepared to be wrong about their assumptions. We hope to arm our allies by giving them the vocabulary and script to respond more fluently to everyday injustices and develop effective allyship. ",

As part of a documentary project about a culturally diverse, low-income community, we recently invited residents to map their neighborhood — not online, but with paper and pens at in-person gatherings. We not only generated unique data, but also stories and context we never would have heard if we hadn’t met people where they lived. \n\nMore and more, journalists are experimenting with community engagement practices to accurately reflect and represent people’s lived experiences. We can do the same by taking an analog approach to creating data, including our community in the stories we tell about them. This helps verify the data by collecting it ourselves and having subject matter experts (your community!) vet it along the way. It also makes our reporting process more transparent and creates a group of people invested in our work. \n\nWe’ll share what we did and what we learned in our neighborhood mapping experiments, and invite a discussion on other ways to weave community engagement into data reporting. Our goal: draft a starter kit of ideas for doing data journalism IRL that you can take back to your newsroom.",

That made a French TV executive think: What if we bring the whole continent together live, one night, over music? He came up with a plan and in 1956, only eleven years after WWII with its deadly conflicts and dozens of millions of victims, the very first Eurovision Song Contest took place in Lugano, Switzerland. It is running up to this day and with more than 150 million people watching on that one night in May, it is the biggest TV show in entertainment on the planet. Nowadays, more than 40 countries send theirs singers and songs. You may have seen some of it and remember the bearded act of Conchita Wurst or Finish metal band Lordi in their monster costumes, or you may now that this was how Abba first got started.\n\nBut apart from that, there is also a secret history of the show: Spanish dictator Franco bribed the Luxemburg jury in 1968 to win hosting rights for the upcoming year and in the early 2000s, countries like Estonia and Latvia made an expensive push to win the competition, so that they could present themselves as reliable international partners ready for the European Union, when hosting the following year, following their informal motto: \"Through EBU into EU\" (EBU being the European Broadcasting Union, the entity organizing Eurovision)\n\nI've been to the event live four times and I visited several of the national preselections. I love to convene people over the idea and discuss the feeling of connection that comes from being in a bar in which Albanian Post-Socialism Rockers jam with Icelandic Punkpop bands - and why I think it is one of the most charming ways to make Europe visible.  So let's have a chat about this, I'm happy to introduce the concept to newbies and talk about why I think that entertainment is a great way to make people wonder about abstract issues they usually have a tougher time relating to.",

And how do we center technology in a newsroom while also fixing the problems news organizations have long had regarding diversity, representing their communities, speaking to their audiences, etc.?\n\nIn this session, we will start with a set of hypotheses to seed discussion.\n\nFor journalism to succeed in the next decade:\n- Newsroom technologists must have real power in their organizations.\n- Experimentation and product development must be central to how a newsroom operates.\n- News organizations must be radically inclusive of their communities.\n- Cultivating positive culture and interpersonal relationships is key to developing sustainable newsrooms.\n\nGiven these hypotheses, what skills do we need to grow in newsroom technologists? What must we think about more deeply in our daily work? What tools do we need to develop? How must this community evolve?

For the first time in decades, the mayor's office was up for grabs with no incumbent and no heir apparent to the 5th floor of City Hall. Meanwhile, the clerk, treasurer and entire 50-seat City Council were up for election. Competition was fierce.\n\nSmall newsrooms faced the daunting task of covering all of these races. More than 200 candidates were running for local office -- including more than a dozen for mayor -- from complete unknowns to career pols. All of this was taking place in a news environment where media often struggles to engage voters and help them make informed decisions.\n\nWith these challenges in mind, a group of five local independent newsrooms decided to pool their resources and work together to create a one-stop resource to serve voters. In a matter of days, the Chi.vote Collaborative was founded, launching a website with candidate profiles, articles, voter resources and other information. The collaborative grew to 10 partners and traffic to the website surged heading into the February election and eventual April runoff. We literally built the car as we drove it, rolling out new features as fast as we could develop them. All while publishing new stories and information daily. \n\nWe quickly learned a lot about collaborating, building on each other's strengths and overcoming challenges. Here are our takeaways, what worked and what didn't, along with tips, insights and all the key technical details that could help you and your collaborators cover the next election.",

Through the lens of systems thinking, we'll open a discussion about some of the big ideas and questions that a change-oriented approach holds for journalists: What new roles can journalists play to help evaluate and facilitate opportunities for social change? How do we negotiate traditional journalistic principles and standards while working to actively dismantle oppressive systems? How can we better communicate and act on our values?\n\nWe'll offer ideas from the systems thinking playbook, discuss examples of journalists who are actively rooting their practice in systems change and lead a visioning exercise to imagine new possibilities.",

Now more than ever, with more nonprofit newsrooms forming, more for-profit newsrooms turning to consumer revenue (on the sales pitch that journalism matters) and trust at a crisis point, we need to measure and show why our work matters. This session will cover published examples and studies but is meant to be a discussion about what we can do — and what’s going too far — to make a difference. We might also, using design thinking strategies, prototype a project designed for impact.",

Similarly, there are plenty of resources for the people on those teams to work, communicate and collaborate effectively. There are also plenty of arguments that have been made for how remote work improves employee effectiveness and satisfaction, why it has economic benefits for employers, and on and on. \n\nAnd yet, national news organizations concentrate their staff in the most expensive cities in the country. Let's try to figure out why that is and help make the case for supporting a more remote-friendly workforce.\n\nIn this session we'll try to come up with as many of the common objections raised by hiring managers when they insist that a given position be based in a particular location and then come up with a playbook of effective arguments to overcome those objections.\n\nAdditionally, we'll come up with some high level talking points regarding how supporting remote work can improve the fundamental economics of journalism while improving the lives of employees and the communities they serve.",

By establishing rhythms of expectation, anticipation, disappointment, and fulfillment, a well-written screenplay keeps us captivated as it directs us through all the plot points and to the heart of the story.\n\nData journalism shares a similar goal. Are there lessons from screenwriting we can use to write engaging, data-driven stories, so we don’t end up with an info dump? Let’s find out together.\n\nIn this session, we’ll participate in a writers’ room to discuss how screenwriters use different strategies to jam-pack information into scenes while building a narrative and keeping pace. Then we’ll try out different screenwriting approaches to see how we can best break down complex data sets in our reporting, guide readers to the story, and keep their attention.

At the same time, journalists with a nontraditional mix of skills, who sit at the intersection of roles, departments or teams — we call them platypuses — are proving to be pivotal to the future of news. So how can newsrooms use the people they have to push their digital initiatives forward? \n\nThis session brings together digital journalists and managers to discuss career growth within the newsroom, especially for people with a nontraditional blend of skills. A lot of growth in digital careers is uncharted territory, but through our empathy interviews we will bring together tips and frameworks for how digital journalists can fit into forward-thinking newsrooms.\n\nWe’ll share success stories and lessons learned, and we’ll workshop tactics that could work in participants’ newsrooms. This session is meant to be a launchpad for conversations and plans to better empower and grow newsroom digital talent — and not lose them to other newsrooms and industries.",
