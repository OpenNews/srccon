        "description": "Like each generation before it, Gen-Z is bringing a new take to the role work plays in our lives—are our workplaces ready for it?\n\nEach generation faces challenges that shape their perspectives, relationships, and ways of showing up in and outside of work: stock market crashes, economic uncertainties, global conflict. The COVID-19 pandemic is no exception, and many following events like the Great Resignation, Return to Office debates, and mass layoffs have further shaped an attitude that questions the role work plays in our daily lives.\n\nIn a climate of difference, how can we create bridges between our generational divides where we can pass lessons both up and down to build a culture of caring and respect? How can we collectively shape the future that we all want to be a part of and build intergenerational relationships upon healthy foundations?",

        "description": "We all want to have deep, meaningful conversations as we report our stories. Yet despite our best intentions, people often leave interviews with journalists feeling like we've not understood them at best or harmed them further at worst. But now, journalists can learn from restorative justice, a discipline that grounds difficult (but healthy) conversations in safety, trust, and transparency.\n\nIn a new resource from Free Press, \"The Moment Is Magic,\" seven RJ practitioners offer transformative, actionable tips journalists can use before, during, and after interviews. Allen Arthur and Diamond Hardiman build on their experiences working in both criminal justice and journalism spaces to adapt these tools to help journalists establish mutual trust and keep people safe during vulnerable moments. In this session, Arthur and Hardiman will be joined by some of the guide's participants for a discussion of the principles and a Q&A.",

        "description": "Those of us who consider ourselves cultural tentpoles within and beyond our organizations know that building culture goes beyond party planning and flashy perks—it’s the prerequisite to creating connection, building community, and driving inclusion and belonging. And as hybrid and remote configurations make distributed work ever more common, the effort in building culture has never been more important or more tricky.\n\nAt the same time, culture-building work—including participating in diversity committees, mentoring, and team programming—often means too many non-promotable tasks, a term coined by authors of ‘The No Club,’ which disproportionately falls on women and employees of color. In this session, we’ll cover how to make this invisible labor not just visible, but celebrated and rewarded.",

This session allows participants to explore the difference between doing things because we think we have to versus allowing ourselves to commit to those things we know we have the capacity to tackle.\n\nHow do we establish what meets the criteria of a commitment? How do we decide what projects and career choices make the most sense? We'll explore personal statements and how they can help us determine how to commit to ourselves and our goals on a daily basis.",

We will explore strategies for covering \"safety\" that don't depend on faulty assumptions or crude statistics such as \"crime\" stats reported by government entities. We will reflect collectively on what it means for journalists to re-imagine safety, and what kinds of stories and media projects can facilitate re-imagining toward a more just world.",

The ways in which we express our curiosity matters a lot: our tone, body language, agendas (or lack thereof) and desired outcomes. They all add up to helping the person on the other end understand if the questions are coming from a place of genuine care, or not.\n\nIn this session, I plan to bring together folks doing incredible work at the intersection of journalism, depolarization and mediation to share tactical approaches and get practiced in a few methods of better question-asking experiences.\n\nThis session can not only help in the acts of creating journalism, but also in any relationship - family, friends, colleagues and strangers.",

They have more power to affect change and have a responsibility to support their staff. However, at the same time, it’s also these leaders that should prevent their teams from being exhausted, the first ones to be hyper-connected and suffering dangerous levels of stress.\n\nIn this session, The Self-Investigation wants to facilitate a discussion about the learnings and strategies of media leaders as they strive to change things up in order to build a healthier environment for their teams. We will share techniques that have been successfully tried and tested. We will also offer the inspiration and knowledge we have accumulated from the many leaders we have trained in our tailor-made courses and through the Knight Center’s MOOCs we designed and ran in three languages, reaching more than 2.500 people from 120 countries and territories.",

We will share community engagement strategies that can help us to slow down our journalism, and make it sustainable -not just for business but for the mental health of all.\n\nAs a conversation starter, I’d like to draw from my personal experience covering low-income Latino immigrant communities in the US: from producing news in the verge of burnout that often left Latino viewers afraid and disempowered, to the challenge of building new mediums and practices to deliver actionable information that helps them navigate the daily demands of a bicultural life.",

This will outline specific opportunities for structural, community care that leaders in the field of journalism can apply to their internal work with their organizations.
