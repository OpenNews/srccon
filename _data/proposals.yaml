How do you keep up with the demands of a 24-hour news cycle if you need special accommodations? What does this mean for your job growth? How do you manage an employee whose function can be unexpectedly limited? How can you live up to your reporting potential when your biology is thwarting you at seemingly every turn?\n\nThis session will start with anecdotes of how facilitators have tackled these tough conversations with bosses and coworkers, sharing what hasn’t worked and what has worked...better. The session will then move to a conversation where participants with disabilities can discuss life in the news industry. Topics could include how people have communicated their needs or accommodations to their employer, experiences working with HR, trying to fit in with the rest of their team or just attempting to get coworkers to understand. The goal of this session is to connect folks with disabilities, share coping techniques, and allow those without disabilities to listen and learn how best to support their colleagues.",

I’ll try to summarize the two approaches and then lead a discussion on how our orgs approach spreadsheets. What are our spreadsheet horror stories?

Bring ideas for projects you’re just considering, especially difficult ones—our exercises will give you a chance to air them to the group, while teaching you how to ask the right questions and really listen to the answers. We get everyone actively involved using Post-its, a “how might we” exercise in which participants frame project goals using a question format, live dot-voting with stickers, scrum-style collaborative group prioritization and planning poker, sketching, and more. \n\nThese sessions rapidly move teams from goal-setting and prioritizing to identifying requirements and even starting nascent deliverables such as a sitemap or sketches. You will learn well-tested strategies for putting your existing narrative skills to work, as we lead you through exercises that will help your team break down and conceptualize next steps. These activities provide ways to iterate quickly while ensuring everyone has a voice in the process. Not only will you turn Post-its and drawings into an immediately actionable backlog, you’ll also come out of our session ready to iterate on this process to improve idea generation for everyday work.

This serves to drive us ever deeper into a narrative of \"us\" vs. \"them.\" But I wonder if there are ways to pop the bubble and close the divide. In the midst of outrage, I find myself nonetheless moved by stories such as this (https://medium.com/s/story/im-a-journalist-and-the-daughter-of-an-n-r-a-member-why-it-s-time-to-tell-my-story-9782ae97aad9) and (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/us/union-jobs-mexico-rexnord.html).

The theory proposes that, rather than \"churn out mediocrity\" with stale innovation processes, we should begin by asking, when a customer chooses a new product or service, \"what job did you hire that product to do?\" \n\nAfter a very brief presentation to set things up, we'll go through a series of exercises, generating a catalog of jobs people need done and possible ways that news organizations could refocus their expertise to help people get those jobs done.

You might be completely satisfied if they solve a specific problem or are designed for a unique use case, but what if you have a general, widely used tool that doesn’t include specific features your newsroom needs? How can you ensure your solution is something people will actually use? We encounter these questions frequently at The New York Times, and we’ve learned that not only is it usually too much work to build something completely new to replace an old system, but also it can be difficult to get users to give up an interface that they are comfortable with. As a result, we often build tools that extend the existing system, but might not live inside of it. A browser extension, a bookmarklet, or a separate UI layer that sits on top of another system – we use all of these solutions to streamline existing workflows in the newsroom. \n\nBut what makes a good tool anyway? And with so many potential areas for improvement, how do you know where to invest? Many of our most successful tools rely on leveraging known UIs and ways of working. We’ll discuss several tools developed at The New York Times that solve some of these problems and ask the room about their own experiences streamlining newsroom workflows.\n\nAfter our discussion, we’ll break into small groups to collectively identify opportunities and ideate tools that build on workflows used in other newsrooms. We’ll crowdsource known issues and navigate scenarios where News Nerds answer the question: How can we solve problems using systems our users already know well?",

It’s not that we’re bad at our jobs. It’s because being \"mobile first\" is surprisingly hard to do. \n\nDeveloping for news means meeting readers wherever they might be, on whatever device they may be using — new or old, small or large, fast or slow. As projects grow more ambitious, it’s more and more challenging to support the full diversity of reader experiences.\n\nThere are plenty of existing platforms that aim to help make the mobile development process more robust and efficient. However, these tools are geared towards the typical case of mobile development, where a developer has fine-grained control over a website or app at the platform level. These platforms don't work as well (or at all) in a newsroom, where interactive content is often constrained by a larger publishing platform.",

Whether you are adding “that one line of JavaScript” as requested by the marketing team, or the Instagram embed in your article. We are allowing our readers (which includes us too) to be tracked across the internet in ways we don’t know about or very often can’t explain.\n\nThis session will start with real and practical approaches to lockdown your site from a privacy perspective (with source code) and best practices on how to minimize data collection and tracking on your visitors. \n\nIt will include a larger discussion to share notes, strategies, concerns from news organizations on how we can improve and do better. The goal is that participants are more aware of the issues, and armed to grapple with privacy concerns in their organizations.",

What would be the best format and the best number of participants to actually produce a plan — a do-able plan — to build a continuing resource that many journalists and journalism orgs could benefit from? Could we include journalism students and some educators in the hackathon? How should a successful hackathon be organized? How do we define \"successful\"?\n\nI'm thinking of a hackathon that aims to spawn something like the California Civic Data Coalition but for public records, FOI data — more a database than a tool, but a database that can be used for more than just getting data out. It would be the hackathon of your dreams, with continued funding and support after the event itself.

On the one hand, I don’t make decisions about our content, so any personal bias has no impact on our news coverage. On the other hand, I know that anything I say could be reflected on the company as a whole, and many news consumers don’t differentiate between editorial and non-editorial employees.\n \nThe value of non-bias/objectivity, whether or not objectivity is possible, and the ways that these policies impact those with marginalized identities is a hot topic of conversation.

Use a systems lens to trace connections between forces within your story.\n\nEach card encapsulates a best practice or perspective that can remind you to start off on the right foot or help you get back in gear if you’re stuck.

As more teams are given the freedom to experiment, the need for a practical model to do it with empathy, intention and a willingness to learn is ever greater. \n\nOver two years in the Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab we developed a sustainable process for running experiments by trying methods out until they (mostly) worked for us. In this session,  we’ll talk about the essential building blocks of our process, take it for a test run, and invite others to share methods they’ve used in their newsrooms. \n\nThe Mobile Lab’s methodology on its surface is pretty simple: \n* draw a line between an idea and an actual hypothesis\n* define success metrics based on all aspects of a user’s experience\n* implement precise analytics\n* survey your audience about how things went\n* have a “burndown” meeting with the entire team to discuss results and insights\n\nThe hard part, we admit, is putting this all together and not losing steam. \n\nFeel free to bring a news experiment idea you want to put through the paces, or we’ll have a few on file to suggest (Obituaries newsletter, anyone?!)",

I'd like to talk about this and other projects I'm working on to think through the ways visualizations can be used to present conclusions or hypotheses made from a dataset.\n\nFrom the simplest poll chart to a movie sales graph to an original simulation that fills in gaps of missing data, when we display a visualization, we are creating for our audience a canvas from which to make inferences. Visualization as a journalistic practice then isn't just about making a finding pop but weighing all the considerations of our analysis or model, including the survey or research design, when choosing a visual form.\n\nI think we all know this, intuitively, but I think we need to be more specific about some of the considerations for presenting data trends, hypotheses, and regression models. Increasingly, we see \"data points heading in one direction\" in a two-axis scatter plot as a kind of journalism. But when is it valid?\n\nFor this talk, I want to talk about what basic assumptions and considerations journalists should make when using simple regressions and what kinds of red flags statisticians look for in bad model selection or diagnosis. Correlation is not, of course, causation, but a dataset that moves linearly in one direction will be interpreted as demonstrating causation to many readers simply because a trend is there.\n\nThere are many other considerations journalists should be making as well: Residuals analysis and heteroskedasticity, p-hacking and overfitting, margin of error and confidence, and overloaded multiple regression models. I'd like to explain how a journalist should be thinking about these questions as opposed to a social scientist or researcher.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd like to reframe questions statisticians usually ask in the context of hypothesis testing, prediction or inference as also another context a set of journalistic questions. When we miss collinearity, we're missing a part of the story that still needs reporting. When we overfit the data, we're sensationalizing a trend. When we p-hack or shove too many variables into a multiple regression, we're relying on an unreliable source. When we place our dataset in a scatter plot, if it is shaped in certain ways, it tell us about underlying issues with our data, and we should learn to spot some of those issues, so we can report it out further and decide how to best present it to our audiences.\n\nThose are some things I'm thinking about all the time. I'd like to put them together into a talk that tries to translate some of the best ideas in statistics (I'll work with statisticians to get it right) into journalistic practices anyone can follow.\n\nI'd also like to find other people in the media who are either building models or thinking a lot about representing findings in data and how audiences make inferences from them that may or may not represent an underlying truth.",

Yet, there are much larger, arguably more scalable media subscription businesses looming overhead: Spotify made $4.6 billion from Premium subscriptions alone in 2017, while Netflix made $11.7 billion and Amazon's numerous subscription verticals raked in $3.2 billion in the same time period.\n\nOne can make a rigorous case that online news sites are now competing directly with these gargantuan media brands for share of users’ time, energy and money.
