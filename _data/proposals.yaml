Drawing inspiration from Peter Schmidt and Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies, a card-based system that offers pithy prompts for creative thinking, we'll discuss ways to shift our perspective in the process of brainstorming, designing and problem-solving. Some of Schmidt and Eno's one-line strategies include:\n\n\"Not building a wall but making a brick.\"\n\"Go to an extreme, move back to a more comfortable place.\"\n\"You can only make one dot at a time.\"\n\nWe'll look at projects that emerged from unconventional sources of inspiration, share our favorite methods of breaking creative block and then develop our own list of \"oblique strategies\" that we'll publish online after the session.",

Congressional representation is at stake, along with $800 billion in federal funds that will get disbursed for state, county, and community programs over the next decade.\n\nWhen KPCC conducted human-centered design research into the census and the opportunities for public service journalism, one finding stood out: We can’t assume educated news consumers know the stakes or the mechanics of the census. There was a very low level of census knowledge among the people we interviewed, including current NPR listeners. How can we address this knowledge gap? We have some ideas. Let's talk.",

Journalists are under surveillance, are increasingly hacked, doxxed and harassed. Over the last several years, numerous journalists and news organizations have reported incidents in which their communications have been hacked, intercepted, or retrieved (Der Spiegel staff, 2015; Wagstaff, 2014). When journalists’ digital accounts are vulnerable to hacks or surveillance, news organizations, journalists, and their sources are at risk. These risks vary and can include financial loss, physical threats, or sources’ unwillingness to share information for fear of related consequences (FDR Group & PEN America, 2013, 2015). \n\nDespite these myriad concerns, many newsrooms lack the resources necessary to build robust and resilient security cultures. This session will address these concerns by documenting the needs of participants and their newsrooms. Drawing on guides like OpenNews’s “Field Guide to Security Training in the Newsroom,” participants will articulate what has worked and what hasn’t – from information security technologies to data policies – in order to identify core themes and challenges. Participants will walk away with a co-created best practices document that they can use as a starting point in their newsrooms to foster robust security cultures in a time of increasing doxing attempts, labor precarity, financial constraints, and decreasing trust in the media.",

How, and if, technology and modern concepts such as artificial intelligence and machine learning can play a role in holding politicians and public figures to account.

In 2014 Associated Press, started automating the production of its quarterly corporate earnings reports. \n\nOnce developed, not only can algorithms create thousands of news stories for a particular topic, they also do it more quickly, cheaply, and potentially with fewer errors than any human journalist. Unsurprisingly, this efficiency has fueled journalists’ fears that automated content production will eventually eliminate newsroom jobs, however some experts see the technology’s potential to improve news quality with a human-machine alliance.",

As we approach a new decade, and arguably a new era of digital journalism, how must newsroom technologists evolve to meet new needs? And how do we center technology in a newsroom while also fixing the problems news organizations have long had regarding diversity, representing their communities, speaking to their audiences, etc.?\n\nIn this session, we will start with a set of hypotheses to seed discussion.\n\nFor journalism to succeed in the next decade:\n- Newsroom technologists must have real power in their organizations.\n- Experimentation and product development must be central to how a newsroom operates.\n- News organizations must be radically inclusive of their communities.\n- Cultivating positive culture and interpersonal relationships is key to developing sustainable newsrooms.\n\nGiven these hypotheses, what skills do we need to grow in newsroom technologists? What must we think about more deeply in our daily work? What tools do we need to develop? How must this community evolve?

For the first time in decades, the mayor's office was up for grabs with no incumbent and no heir apparent to the 5th floor of City Hall. Meanwhile, the clerk, treasurer and entire 50-seat City Council were up for election. Competition was fierce.\n\nSmall newsrooms faced the daunting task of covering all of these races. More than 200 candidates were running for local office -- including more than a dozen for mayor -- from complete unknowns to career pols. All of this was taking place in a news environment where media often struggles to engage voters and help them make informed decisions.\n\nWith these challenges in mind, a group of five local independent newsrooms decided to pool their resources and work together to create a one-stop resource to serve voters. In a matter of days, the Chi.vote Collaborative was founded, launching a website with candidate profiles, articles, voter resources and other information. The collaborative grew to 10 partners and traffic to the website surged heading into the February election and eventual April runoff. We literally built the car as we drove it, rolling out new features as fast as we could develop them. All while publishing new stories and information daily. \n\nWe quickly learned a lot about collaborating, building on each other's strengths and overcoming challenges.

The study states “it is likely that doctors recurrently witness the tremendous suffering their terminally ill patients experience as they undergo ineffective, high intensity treatments at the end of life and they (the doctors) consequentially wish to forego such treatments for themselves.” What does journalism look like under such a lens? How would we cover the next shooting? The next devastating natural disaster? A personal tragedy? A public embarrassment?

How do we want our stories told?\n\nWe’ve combined our backgrounds in narrative medicine, local journalism, ethics and access research into a project examining the parallels in how health care and journalism have evolved in the U.S. Across both fields, practitioners often cite the appeal of service to others as why they do the work, but are communities truly being served? The very practices of health care and journalism are shaped, challenged, and even threatened by the compromises created by the conflict between delivering a service and seeking revenue. They both have become industries that suffer from lack of access for local or rural communities, are distorted by the drive for profit or financial influence (like insurance companies and hedge-fund owners), deeply ingrained problems with diversity and representation and questions of agency, ethics, autonomy and participation from the people on the other side of the pen and stethoscope.\n\nJoin us for a frank group discussion and brainstorming session around the parallels between medicine and journalism and to push toward solutions that make our communities healthier—physically, emotionally and intellectually.",

They will track the adoption of an agile development mindset and discuss when it does and does not work. Finally, they will showcase the Post’s user testing lab and how the results from periodic qualitative feedback have shaped the development roadmap. This is a session for attendees who want a peek inside the Post’s research advertising arm and those who want to know how to manage a development team through significant growth. We also will discuss how R&D groups at other publications can partner with RED in the ad tech and journalism space.",

Our work is often geared to spark surface-level outcomes (a law was passed, an official was held accountable, etc.), but even when media organizations are equipped to do deeper investigative work, they often don’t invest in longer-term strategies that can illuminate pathways for citizens to create more equitable, healthy systems.\n\nUsing a practice called systems thinking – a holistic approach to grappling with complex issues – journalists can develop more collaborative frameworks that help people build power and resiliency to address some of our most deeply rooted problems. Through the lens of systems thinking, we'll open a discussion about some of the big ideas and questions that a change-oriented approach holds for journalists: What new roles can journalists play to help evaluate and facilitate opportunities for social change? How do we negotiate traditional journalistic principles and standards while working to actively dismantle oppressive systems? How can we better communicate and act on our values?\n\nWe'll offer ideas from the systems thinking playbook, discuss examples of journalists who are actively rooting their practice in systems change and lead a visioning exercise to imagine new possibilities.",

This has helped us to improve the project beyond what we had initially anticipated. \n\nBiggest discovery was that a lot of the key to a successful open source strategy was around the so called “soft skills”. Curating the project and communication within the contributors, drafting\ndocumentation, guides, ADR (architecture decision record), as well as talking to contributors and learn more about their use cases, online and offline.\n\nWe also discovered that it was instrumental in transferring our project to a production team to scale it to the rest of the organization.\n\nWill discuss what has worked, and what hasn’t worked for participants, and divide into groups to knowledge share potential open sourcing strategies.\n\nThis session welcomes both people who have no open source experience and are curious about how to get started as well as seasoned open source contributors/maintainers and anything in between.",

We've conducted big data analysis of the web reading behavior of paying subscribers, and we're exploring ways to introduce students to media product development methods and seeing how we can boost their work with Knight Lab's development staff. We have some other projects starting to take shape, and we'll be seeking more funding to continue the work and extend it to new partners and different environments.\n\n In this session, we'll talk about what we've done so far, but, more importantly, we want to talk with people working in local news to get direct perspectives on the challenges and opportunities they are experiencing. After a brief presentation about the project, we'll use some structured conversation methods to learn about what's needed and identify interesting opportunities for us to help.",

The Stack is the one-stop shop for students interested in the intersection of data insights, coding and storytelling at UCLA. When I joined as a contributor in Fall 2017, the section had lost some of its best contributors and struggled in leadership and productivity for a whole academic year. There was a lack of camaraderie and need for collaboration which hindered the ability to produce much output as well, which took a long time to rework. Ensuring that data sections still work well and are adapting to the world around them is a tough deal.\n\nI hope to discuss not only the challenges of starting a student-run data journalism section, but ensuring its continuity and sustaining the content it produces for the community it serves. I'm interested in talking about how to engage with the local data journalism community (having LAT Data Desk employees who used to work at Daily Bruin to train students, for example) was crucial for boosting morale. Pushing to hire diverse students with varied skill sets and different backgrounds allowed for sensitive stories and working with data and sourcing in a more human-centered way. Working with senior leaders to incorporate data literacy and accessibility in small ways, as well as working with sensitive data (for example an interactive map allowing students to document their personal experiences with sexual violence anonymously) helps push boundaries and is worth investing in, in student newsrooms.",

It's a part of our journalistic economy, as the money and power in journalism is focused in just a few geographic locations--but it can also be damaging to local communities, and it can lead to misrepresentation, distrust and resentment. Often, national journalists appear in a community in times of trauma and elections, and report stories with insufficient context, while local journalists struggle to access equivalent resources for necessary ongoing reporting. This session will explore our collective experiences with parachute journalism as both insiders and outsiders to a community, in order to produce good ideas about how to do harm reduction, increase accountability, and shift power dynamics. We'll ask: Are there situations where it's better if this story just doesn't get told? How do we evaluate that? What can national media outlets and freelancers do to connect and collaborate with local journalists and local communities? What are the ethics of accountable partnerships? In what ways do local and regional/national media needs differ, and how can journalists collaborate to produce stories that better address the needs of all involved?

Newsrooms are also producing short novels' worth of non political news, cultural criticism and other feature pieces that are not only great journalism but also important counter programming to the political coverage. At The Times, all this journalism exists online and in the paper but promoting a story on the web home page or on social really boosts a story's reach. For many readers, the articles chosen to appear on those platforms become their main understanding of our report.\n\nHow do news organizations best surface content to readers? How can we use technology to aid what is ultimately an editorial decision about what stories go on the limited real estate that exists in those platforms (the home page, Twitter and FB)? As we retool our home page programming tools at The Times (and other platform programming tools soon too!), personalization and machine learning/AI to suggest content for promotion are things that have been talked about and experimented with.

Those are both management and individual contributors positions. \n\nEach Sponsee is matched with an executive sponsor (Executive Director to CTO) specifically tasked to help them get larger positions. \n\nIn the first year we've already had 80% of the participants promoted, while retaining our rigorous promotions process. No free rides! Each promotion is well earned. \n\nThere was a ton of discussion, planning, and hard decisions that went into building this program. The goal of this session is to provide you with everything that we learned in making is successful, and give you all the tool you need to bring a nearly fully-baked proposal back to you your company. \n\nThis session will take you through:\n\n- How we determined the scope of the program\n- Who was ultimately brought in, and promoted\n- The structures that we invested in to make it work (trainings, facilitators, executive outreach, and internal Sponsor recruitment)\n- Q&A on the challenges faced and what we needed to make it work",

As part of a documentary project about a culturally diverse, low-income community, we recently invited residents to map their neighborhood — not online, but with paper and pens at in-person gatherings. We not only generated unique data, but also stories and context we never would have heard if we hadn’t met people where they lived. \n\nMore and more, journalists are experimenting with community engagement practices to accurately reflect and represent people’s lived experiences. We can do the same by taking an analog approach to creating data, including our community in the stories we tell about them. This helps verify the data by collecting it ourselves and having subject matter experts (your community!) vet it along the way. It also makes our reporting process more transparent and creates a group of people invested in our work. \n\nWe’ll share what we did and what we learned in our neighborhood mapping experiments, and invite a discussion on other ways to weave community engagement into data reporting. Our goal: draft a starter kit of ideas for doing data journalism IRL that you can take back to your newsroom.",

Whether you thrive on the social and logistical challenge of navigating a new workplace, or are driven to anxiety just thinking about it, we can all agree that a lot of workplaces throw new folks into the deep end of the pool without much structure or forethought.\n\nThis session is about bringing more intentionality to new team member onboarding, integration, and inclusion. Even if we're not in a position of official hiring authority at work, we almost all have some part in the experience of newcomers to our teams and organizations.\n\nFirst, we'll share as a large group some of our own experiences and ideas about how to best facilitate the integration of new members of our own teams.\n\nThen, we'll break up into a few fictional \"companies\" -- each with its own norms, culture, and inside jokes -- and a develop proactive program to onboard our new people. Finally, we'll see how our ideas work by switching tables and going through another \"company's\" process.",

Small dollar donations have been a dominant force in politics since the Obama campaign in 2008, but in 2018, that finally reached the local level (from congressional races to district attorney races and everything in-between) in a real way. Powered by grassroots groups, candidates began to draw a high volume of donations of $50 and less from people that live nowhere near the areas they represent.\n\nJournalism has lessons to learn from the 2018 election. Principally, in the hunt for new revenue, identifying small dollar donors that care about your mission can be a potential outlet for financing journalism in markets around the country. Is there a way for locally-focused organizations to build up an audience of revenue-generating customers that live outside of the areas they serve? If so, what can we learn from how political organizations and campaigns have operated?",

        "description": "Companies often lament that they are trying to hire a more diverse community of engineers, but that they struggle to find strong candidates. But if companies want to hire more diverse candidates, they need to be open to the idea of hiring people with diverse educational backgrounds: people without college degrees, people who are self-taught, and people who went to a boot camp.\n \nNewsrooms and product organizations that are reluctant to hire candidates from non-traditional educational backgrounds eliminate a host of candidates right off the bat. How can teams and managers become more confident in non-traditionally educated engineers? If employers were better aware of what knowledge these engineers may not have, they could prepare both these new engineers and their current team, fostering an environment more easily able to absorb this kind of talent.\n \nI want to talk with engineers from non-traditional educational backgrounds about the things they encountered that “everyone seemed to know”. What did they get stuck on starting their first job but were too embarrassed to ask? I want to talk with hirers about their experiences hiring first time professional engineers, and some of the things that have held them back from doing so. What support did they think they needed to have in place to take them on? I hope for people to leave with a greater understanding of each other’s fears and new ideas for how to onboard more diverse groups of engineers.",

Many of us have probably been the first person to hold a position within our organizations - or will be that person at some point in our careers. For example: An editor who once focused on text may now be involved in audience development or audio. A product manager working on a traditional CMS now may start overseeing strategy for voice-activated devices or AI. \n\nSo when you’re breaking new ground in a newsroom or starting something that’s new to you, how do you best get your head around the new technologies, frameworks for decision-making or ways of working that become central to the new role you’re taking on? How do you do so quickly and thoroughly enough to have a good understanding without spending too much time going down rabbit holes or making yourself crazy in the pursuit of a ‘complete’ body of knowledge? \n\nLet's brainstorm about ways to self-educate for new work situations that might help with these beginnings -- and what kinds of support we might ask for from the people we work with and the organizations we work in. Come with any examples of what's helped you -- or what hasn't -- when taking on something new.",

But before long, that vision seemed caught up in overly-complex abstractions and doomed to obscurity.\nMeanwhile, a combination of technology growth and recalibrated expectations may have set the stage for a new approach to achieving these goals. Wikipedia, better known for its collaborative, volunteer-written articles, has also incorporated its sister project Wikidata for structuring data in its pages and disambiguating names with stable identifiers. And, the Schema.org standards group has come up with simpler ways for web publishers to make their intentions explicit, empowering application developers to work with that information without needing Google-scale resources.\nIn this session, we’ll look at these two developments. We’ll provide a practical introduction to working with Wikidata and its related APIs and datasets, and, we’ll discuss what might be possible if structured data was more completely baked into our research, articles, or web applications.",

If we knew something needed to happen to make things better, could we identify a few levers to pull that’d make that something more likely? Would we frame the story differently? Share the data openly? Talk to different sources? And how do we do all of this without going too far, without crossing into advocacy journalism? Now more than ever, with more nonprofit newsrooms forming, more for-profit newsrooms turning to consumer revenue (on the sales pitch that journalism matters) and trust at a crisis point, we need to measure and show why our work matters. This session will cover published examples and studies but is meant to be a discussion about what we can do — and what’s going too far — to make a difference. We might also, using design thinking strategies, prototype a project designed for impact.",

We are in the midst of building out a platform for newsrooms to share not only data, but story recipes and methodologies. We want to use the great work being done in data-driven, accountability journalism to inspire others in small and large newsrooms throughout the country.\n\nWe’ve already begun. Earlier this year Big Local News released an update to a database of police traffic stops, collected and standardized from dozens of different police agencies around the country. The release was the result of a partnership with the Stanford Computational Policy Lab and timed to around a pre-NICAR workshop where we taught journalists how to analyze the data to uncover patterns in racial disparity.\n\nWe also started a conversation at NICAR centered around a coordinated effort to collect more police data. We want to expand on that conversation now. What other datasets can we be collecting in health care, education and other important local topics? How can we help local newsrooms not only collect data, but analyze and archive it for others to work with? And how do we incentivize such efforts? What obstacles are there to building a cooperative environment where data is shared freely between newsrooms and how do we overcome them? And lastly, what features would you like to see in a platform that would facilitate this effort?\n\nCome help us answer these questions and build a network to collect and sharing data for use in accountability journalism. And if you have data to share, bring that too.",

Such an organization would also have its own limitations and we want this discussion to be a frank conversation about what those could be and how we could work around them.\n\nFor a part of the session, we want to break into small groups to think about how they would organize their ideal organization.
