But surprisingly discussions around it are generally not very productive. The tension with product teams and journalists is often whether you spend six months or longer on a high profile feature piece or platform or make tweaks to your CMS to make it more innovative and forward-thinking.\n\nAt the BBC News Labs we experimented with 6 week project sprints and as part of one of these first project sprints we made an “interactive” graphic novel/comic book story with the BBC World service. We want to share our experience of how you go from defining an idea with editorial stakeholders, iterating and delivering on that while creating an experience that reaches a global audience under time pressure. Can a prototype ever be production ready code?\n\nWe are also keen to hear from others that might have tried doing experiments and promote innovation in their newsroom to knowledge share on what tweaks and tricks might have worked as well as biggest challenges. Let's see if we can come up with the main points for an outline for a virtual “rapid prototyping from idea to working product handbook.”",

We wrote The SQL Song to help one group of boot camp attendees understand the order of commands. In an attempt to help students fine-tune their programs, we did a game show called Query Cash. To make string functions make more sense, we’ve created silly, but useful performances. To make this session interactive, we propose inviting attendees to bring their ideas. We also will pose some problems and have teams work out creative solutions.",

Yet, there are much larger, arguably more scalable media subscription businesses looming overhead: Spotify made $4.6 billion from Premium subscriptions alone in 2017, while Netflix made $11.7 billion and Amazon's numerous subscription verticals raked in $3.2 billion in the same time period.\n\nOne can make a rigorous case that online news sites are now competing directly with these gargantuan media brands for share of users’ time, energy and money. But should music and video streaming services really be the new benchmark for all of media?\n\nThrough a series of interactive activities, we'll dive into what journalists could learn from the Spotify/Netflix/Amazon model about building experiences that foster both participation and loyalty with readers and subscribers—and where that model might fall short for news. We invite participants to bring their own examples of this strategic cross-pollination from their own organizations, which we'll workshop in small groups with visual, design-oriented exercises (read: many Post-it notes!).\n\nOn a higher level, our goal is take a serious, hands-on look at what the phrase \"media convergence\" really means and whether it's a truly viable future for the news business, with streaming as our lens.",

It's ridiculously time-intensive for a few people on the team, but 1,000% worth it.\n\nLike-minded news nerds like Brittany Mayes (NPR) and Sisi Wei (ProPublica) have spoken eloquently about their efforts for internships and fellowships.  SRCCON audiences have been appreciative and very attentive, which means there's more to pursue on the topic.  Few teams can spare the time, but we have a window available _now_ for getting well ahead of any given news org's \"rebooted\" corporate recruiting and hiring efforts.  News nerd teams can cut the trail by adopting hiring practices that truly put our shared ideals front and center, as a demonstration for newsroom and technology groups.\n\nNYT's Interactive News will soon have four full-time hires worth of investment in refining our revamped hiring practices, which have moved us from unambitious box-ticking to some ridiculously hard debates about terrifyingly talented finalists.  Simultaneously, we are actively building a strong recruiting operation for future open positions.  (And my in-house \"expertise\" — aka, firm opinions and elaborate spreadsheets — have resulted in me being part of initiatives to shift the NYT's Technology hiring, too.)
