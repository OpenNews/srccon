        "description": "Diversity initiatives are popping up in most companies these days. Newsrooms are talking about gender and race representation, re-examining how we cover stories and how we create space for employees of all genders and races. We laud ourselves for being aware and being inclusive. However, noticeably missing from the conversation, at least for those who identify as such, are the disabled. \n\nThe New York Times has employee lead initiatives to help correct that. From the tech task force that turned into a team designated with making our site more accessible, to the internal panel on employees with disabilities that turned into an employee resource group the disabled community and their allies at the times are standing up and taking space. \n\nDuring this session we will examine how the disability community is represented in newsrooms and institutions, discuss what has been done, and set a framework for how to take action now. We will work together to figure out what ally-ship looks like and what it means for diversity initiatives to include the disabled, and how they miss the mark when they don’t -- both for employees and our coverage.",

At the same time, journalists with a nontraditional mix of skills, who sit at the intersection of roles, departments or teams — we call them platypuses — are proving to be pivotal to the future of news. So how can newsrooms use the people they have to push their digital initiatives forward? \n\nThis session brings together digital journalists and managers to discuss career growth within the newsroom, especially for people with a nontraditional blend of skills. A lot of growth in digital careers is uncharted territory, but through our empathy interviews we will bring together tips and frameworks for how digital journalists can fit into forward-thinking newsrooms.\n\nWe’ll share success stories and lessons learned, and we’ll workshop tactics that could work in participants’ newsrooms. This session is meant to be a launchpad for conversations and plans to better empower and grow newsroom digital talent — and not lose them to other newsrooms and industries.",

These are the questions this practical and conversational session seeks to answer. In the past few years, algorithms have been used to automatically generate news from structured data. In 2014 Associated Press, started automating the production of its quarterly corporate earnings reports. \n\nOnce developed, not only can algorithms create thousands of news stories for a particular topic, they also do it more quickly, cheaply, and potentially with fewer errors than any human journalist. Unsurprisingly, this efficiency has fueled journalists’ fears that automated content production will eventually eliminate newsroom jobs, however some experts see the technology’s potential to improve news quality with a human-machine alliance.",

Congressional representation is at stake, along with $800 billion in federal funds that will get disbursed for state, county, and community programs over the next decade.\n\nWhen KPCC conducted human-centered design research into the census and the opportunities for public service journalism, one finding stood out: We can’t assume educated news consumers know the stakes or the mechanics of the census. There was a very low level of census knowledge among the people we interviewed, including current NPR listeners. How can we address this knowledge gap? We have some ideas. Let's talk.",
