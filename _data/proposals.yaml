We've conducted big data analysis of the web reading behavior of paying subscribers, and we're exploring ways to introduce students to media product development methods and seeing how we can boost their work with Knight Lab's development staff. We have some other projects starting to take shape, and we'll be seeking more funding to continue the work and extend it to new partners and different environments.\n\n In this session, we'll talk about what we've done so far, but, more importantly, we want to talk with people working in local news to get direct perspectives on the challenges and opportunities they are experiencing. After a brief presentation about the project, we'll use some structured conversation methods to learn about what's needed and identify interesting opportunities for us to help.",

It's a part of our journalistic economy, as the money and power in journalism is focused in just a few geographic locations--but it can also be damaging to local communities, and it can lead to misrepresentation, distrust and resentment. Often, national journalists appear in a community in times of trauma and elections, and report stories with insufficient context, while local journalists struggle to access equivalent resources for necessary ongoing reporting. This session will explore our collective experiences with parachute journalism as both insiders and outsiders to a community, in order to produce good ideas about how to do harm reduction, increase accountability, and shift power dynamics. We'll ask: Are there situations where it's better if this story just doesn't get told? How do we evaluate that? What can national media outlets and freelancers do to connect and collaborate with local journalists and local communities? What are the ethics of accountable partnerships? In what ways do local and regional/national media needs differ, and how can journalists collaborate to produce stories that better address the needs of all involved? All of this will be driving at a larger question: What does justice and accountability look like in the practice of journalism?",

Whether you thrive on the social and logistical challenge of navigating a new workplace, or are driven to anxiety just thinking about it, we can all agree that a lot of workplaces throw new folks into the deep end of the pool without much structure or forethought.\n\nThis session is about bringing more intentionality to new team member onboarding, integration, and inclusion. Even if we're not in a position of official hiring authority at work, we almost all have some part in the experience of newcomers to our teams and organizations.\n\nFirst, we'll share as a large group some of our own experiences and ideas about how to best facilitate the integration of new members of our own teams.\n\nThen, we'll break up into a few fictional \"companies\" -- each with its own norms, culture, and inside jokes -- and a develop proactive program to onboard our new people. Finally, we'll see how our ideas work by switching tables and going through another \"company's\" process.",

What is our relationship to democracy and how do we cultivate more of it? \n\nThis session follows a session from SRCCON:POWER where participants developed consensus definitions for democracy and brainstormed ways to cultivate a more thoughtful democratic practice in their work. (Read more about it here: https://medium.com/@simongalp/5-ways-to-make-your-workplace-more-democratic-730aa1fdc87f).

At the same time, journalists with a nontraditional mix of skills, who sit at the intersection of roles, departments or teams — we call them platypuses — are proving to be pivotal to the future of news. So how can newsrooms use the people they have to push their digital initiatives forward? \n\nThis session brings together digital journalists and managers to discuss career growth within the newsroom, especially for people with a nontraditional blend of skills. A lot of growth in digital careers is uncharted territory, but through our empathy interviews we will bring together tips and frameworks for how digital journalists can fit into forward-thinking newsrooms.\n\nWe’ll share success stories and lessons learned, and we’ll workshop tactics that could work in participants’ newsrooms. This session is meant to be a launchpad for conversations and plans to better empower and grow newsroom digital talent — and not lose them to other newsrooms and industries.",

And how do we center technology in a newsroom while also fixing the problems news organizations have long had regarding diversity, representing their communities, speaking to their audiences, etc.?\n\nIn this session, we will start with a set of hypotheses to seed discussion.\n\nFor journalism to succeed in the next decade:\n- Newsroom technologists must have real power in their organizations.\n- Experimentation and product development must be central to how a newsroom operates.\n- News organizations must be radically inclusive of their communities.\n- Cultivating positive culture and interpersonal relationships is key to developing sustainable newsrooms.\n\nGiven these hypotheses, what skills do we need to grow in newsroom technologists? What must we think about more deeply in our daily work? What tools do we need to develop? How must this community evolve?

These are the questions this practical and conversational session seeks to answer. In the past few years, algorithms have been used to automatically generate news from structured data. In 2014 Associated Press, started automating the production of its quarterly corporate earnings reports. \n\nOnce developed, not only can algorithms create thousands of news stories for a particular topic, they also do it more quickly, cheaply, and potentially with fewer errors than any human journalist. Unsurprisingly, this efficiency has fueled journalists’ fears that automated content production will eventually eliminate newsroom jobs, however some experts see the technology’s potential to improve news quality with a human-machine alliance.",
