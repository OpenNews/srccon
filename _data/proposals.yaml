In addition to a massive brainstorm and review of best practices for leading change and innovation, we'll pair you with a secret pen pal who will help keep you accountable for your goal. \n\nSome examples: \n- Robert regularly works with students in the world academia to force innovation. \n- Emma changed the way her newsroom filed stories and mandated Slack for the whole company. \n- Karen’s newsroom instituted an initiative where each month, reporters and editors hold a lab week to experiment with new ideas\n\nWe want participants to go back to their newsrooms on Monday armed with a new confidence for making change, a list of best practices to try employing, and a specific goal in mind to start work on immediately. Further, we'll pair folks up with a secret pen pal from the session to help keep them accountable in six weeks, six months.",

How does that affect your newsroom experience and how the news is covered in America’s increasingly divisive political and social climate? We’ll begin the session with an exercise that explores our own identities. Different identities impact the work you do and how you interact with others.

But then again, isn't it just storytelling?\n\nBy bringing journalists, developers and digital creatives together, we can empower journalists to think about how they want their story to be told.
