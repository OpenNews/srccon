What responsibilities do we have to the privacy of the communities we report on? While many journalists have [struggled with this question](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T71OE4fm4ns0ugEOmKOY4xF4H9ikbebmikv96sgi16A/edit), few newsrooms have an explicit ethics policy on how they retain, release, and redact personally-identifiable information. Let's change that, by drafting a sample PII ethics policy that can be adopted by organizations both large and small.",

Come to this session if you want to feel better about how far you've come and if you want some inspiration to look at your projects in a new light.",

But data I've compiled shows that the best work of the year is often backloaded into November and December, when most contest deadlines come due.

These are the questions this practical and conversational session seeks to answer. In the past few years, algorithms have been used to automatically generate news from structured data. In 2014 Associated Press, started automating the production of its quarterly corporate earnings reports. \n\nOnce developed, not only can algorithms create thousands of news stories for a particular topic, they also do it more quickly, cheaply, and potentially with fewer errors than any human journalist. Unsurprisingly, this efficiency has fueled journalists’ fears that automated content production will eventually eliminate newsroom jobs, however some experts see the technology’s potential to improve news quality with a human-machine alliance.",

The census is making headlines because several states are suing the Trump administration over its plans to include a citizenship question. But much of the news glosses over why the census is important and how it affects everyone’s lives. Congressional representation is at stake, along with $800 billion in federal funds that will get disbursed for state, county, and community programs over the next decade.\n\nWhen KPCC conducted human-centered design research into the census and the opportunities for public service journalism, one finding stood out: We can’t assume educated news consumers know the stakes or the mechanics of the census. There was a very low level of census knowledge among the people we interviewed, including current NPR listeners. How can we address this knowledge gap? We have some ideas. Let's talk.",
