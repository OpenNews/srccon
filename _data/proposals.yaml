On the other hand, the digital offerings of older more mature publishers still mirror their print counterpart: Content is ordered by section and readers have no control over what they see. In this session, we want to explore if and how customizable feeds can work within a more traditional news website or app. \n\nHere are some questions we want to discuss: How does one build a feed to begin with? How can users personalize it to their interests? By adopting the feed concept, are we just one step closer to trapping our readers inside their own filter bubbles? How may we responsibly use algorithms to improve the relevance of a news feed? How, if at all, can we involve editors in the process? What is good data to collect in order to power a valuable feed for readers\n\nIn this session, we’ll share how we’ve started to answer some of these questions at The New York Times and how organizations can begin to program the most relevant journalism for their readers.",

One of the first roles for most reporters and photographers is covering breaking news - chasing the police scanner from one traumatic event to the next. Our newsroom might have to cover a traumatic event on a larger scale - a mass shooting, a devastating brush fire, hurricane or tornado. We take care to tell the stories of those affected, to make sure their voices and their grief are heard. But we also need to take care of ourselves and our colleagues in these moments. What should you be looking for to make sure you're protected and feel empowered to speak up for yourself when you don't feel comfortable or need help? What are some things you could do if you are the editor to take care of your staff? What types of services could news organizations offer that would help in these situations?",

It's a part of our journalistic economy, as the money and power in journalism is focused in just a few geographic locations--but it can also be damaging to local communities, and it can lead to misrepresentation, distrust and resentment. Often, national journalists appear in a community in times of trauma and elections, and report stories with insufficient context, while local journalists struggle to access equivalent resources for necessary ongoing reporting. This session will explore our collective experiences with parachute journalism as both insiders and outsiders to a community, in order to produce good ideas about how to do harm reduction, increase accountability, and shift power dynamics. We'll ask: Are there situations where it's better if this story just doesn't get told? How do we evaluate that? What can national media outlets and freelancers do to connect and collaborate with local journalists and local communities? What are the ethics of accountable partnerships? In what ways do local and regional/national media needs differ, and how can journalists collaborate to produce stories that better address the needs of all involved?

How do you think about the visual purpose? E.g. visuals as evidence, for empathy, or an emotional journey? We also want to hear everyone’s favorite tactics for visual research: how to get the visuals or the information to make them, from crowd-sourcing, open datasets, records requests, Google Earth, to interview tips. Finally, as we all know, visual stories tend to take more time than standard stories. What’s your process? How does your newsroom think about planning, setting expectations, and scoping (and the fact that it’s possible to rush edit a half-finished text into publishable form in a day if needed but not possible to hack a half-finished code project into functional form in a day)?",

        "description": "Over the past few decades, newsroom technologists have pushed the field of journalism forward in countless ways. As we approach a new decade, and arguably a new era of digital journalism, how must newsroom technologists evolve to meet new needs? And how do we center technology in a newsroom while also fixing the problems news organizations have long had regarding diversity, representing their communities, speaking to their audiences, etc.?\n\nIn this session, we will start with a set of hypotheses to seed discussion.\n\nFor journalism to succeed in the next decade:\n- Newsroom technologists must have real power in their organizations.\n- Experimentation and product development must be central to how a newsroom operates.\n- News organizations must be radically inclusive of their communities.\n- Cultivating positive culture and interpersonal relationships is key to developing sustainable newsrooms.\n\nGiven these hypotheses, what skills do we need to grow in newsroom technologists? What must we think about more deeply in our daily work? What tools do we need to develop? How must this community evolve? Together, let’s brainstorm these questions and leave with ideas to explore and deepen newsroom technology and culture beyond SRCCON.",

But data I've compiled shows that the best work of the year is often backloaded into November and December, when most contest deadlines come due.  But this is also likely the least ideal time for big impactful work to come out as regular people and those with power to effectuate change leave work for the holidays. Let's have a discussion about how we can change that, to be able to fete our peers while also remaining true to our mission.",

These are the questions this practical and conversational session seeks to answer. In the past few years, algorithms have been used to automatically generate news from structured data. In 2014 Associated Press, started automating the production of its quarterly corporate earnings reports. \n\nOnce developed, not only can algorithms create thousands of news stories for a particular topic, they also do it more quickly, cheaply, and potentially with fewer errors than any human journalist. Unsurprisingly, this efficiency has fueled journalists’ fears that automated content production will eventually eliminate newsroom jobs, however some experts see the technology’s potential to improve news quality with a human-machine alliance.",

The census is making headlines because several states are suing the Trump administration over its plans to include a citizenship question. But much of the news glosses over why the census is important and how it affects everyone’s lives. Congressional representation is at stake, along with $800 billion in federal funds that will get disbursed for state, county, and community programs over the next decade.\n\nWhen KPCC conducted human-centered design research into the census and the opportunities for public service journalism, one finding stood out: We can’t assume educated news consumers know the stakes or the mechanics of the census. There was a very low level of census knowledge among the people we interviewed, including current NPR listeners. How can we address this knowledge gap? We have some ideas. Let's talk.",
