We'll review some of MPP's user research materials and findings, and then create opportunities for workshopping and small team exercises focused on designing the right membership program and offerings for your space and organization.",

Now is the moment for intelligent publishers to put a hand back on the wheel and reassert their ethical imperative in the next generation of ad tech.\n\nWe will be bringing a proposed draft for API-driven advertising to this session. We'll run through what we have, the thinking behind it and the types of products we believe the API schema can drive. We'll end the session by sitting down with participants and working through criticism and ideas for alterations. Our goal is to build a schema that content management systems and advertising back ends can share, allowing different publishers and third parties to communicate server to server.

For, come now, could you tell me what the beautiful is?”  I was at a loss and could not answer him properly.\nCome, then, Hippias, let me rehearse:  I shall say that if a beautiful person is beautiful, there is something by reason of which he or she would be beautiful.\n“How charming you are, Socrates!” he will say. “But is not a beautiful horse beautiful, which even the god praised in his oracle?”\nWhat shall we say, Hippias? How could we dare to deny that the beautiful thing is beautiful?\n\nHIPPIAS:\nQuite true, Socrates, for very beautiful horses are bred in our country.\n\nSOCRATES:\n“Very well,” he will say, “and how about a beautiful lyre? Is it not beautiful?”\nShall we agree, Hippias?\n\nHIPPIAS:\nYes.\n\nSOCRATES:\nAfter this, then, the man will ask, I am sure, “You most excellent man, how about a beautiful pot?”\n\nHIPPIAS:\nWhat an uncultivated fellow!\n\nSOCRATES:\nThat’s the kind of person he is, Hippias, not elegant, but vulgar, thinking of nothing but the truth.\n\n  -- Liberal paraphrasing of Plato's *Hippias Major*, 286d - 288e\n\n\nIt's hard enough for many of us to just explain what we do for a living; how could we expect people outside our field to understand that there's actually beauty in it?  Because there is, isn't there?\n\nLet's gather for a little symposium on the subject. We will start with a few presentations by fellow attendees on concrete examples of beauty they have discovered in their own work: a perfect one-liner, an exquisite pivot table, an interface that brings harmony to an unruly application.  Then we'll open the floor to more examples and discussion.  \n\nWe will enjoy the beauty of watching each other describe the beautiful, and find courage to share our own unsung experiences of beauty.  We'll draw connections between beauty in our fields and others.  We'll resolve to dig around in our old work for treasures.  We'll consider ways we can keep our most beautiful creations close by in our everyday work, as private inspiration and affirmation.\n\nIf you are interested in being one of our presenters, contact me at scott.blumenthal@nytimes.com.",

The platform handles the boring nuts-and-bolts of newsmaking — and we get to do the cool stuff. \nWhat if designers and developers were more involved in platform-level tooling and software? What does it look like to get over the fear of the complexities of platform and native app architecture, and love it for what it can offer — reusable, scalable tools, and broad exposure to the rest of your newsroom?\nDrawing on our shared experiences building tools for newsrooms, in this workshop, we’ll look at using ProseMirror, the basis of The New York Time’s new editing interface, to see how meeting editors and reporters where they are already working can crack open the door to story innovation.",

But surprisingly discussions around it are generally not very productive. The tension with product teams and journalists is often whether you spend six months or longer on a high profile feature piece or platform or make tweaks to your CMS to make it more innovative and forward-thinking.\n\nAt the BBC News Labs we experimented with 6 week project sprints and as part of one of these first project sprints we made an “interactive” graphic novel/comic book story with the BBC World service. We want to share our experience of how you go from defining an idea with editorial stakeholders, iterating and delivering on that while creating an experience that reaches a global audience under time pressure. Can a prototype ever be production ready code?\n\nWe are also keen to hear from others that might have tried doing experiments and promote innovation in their newsroom to knowledge share on what tweaks and tricks might have worked as well as biggest challenges. Let's see if we can come up with the main points for an outline for a virtual “rapid prototyping from idea to working product handbook.”",

        "description": "Let’s be clear: a lot of experimentation is happening in newsrooms right now. But let’s also be honest: it’s predominantly being done in a messy, ad-hoc way and we’re too quick to move on. As more teams are given the freedom to experiment, the need for a practical model to do it with empathy, intention and a willingness to learn is ever greater. \n\nOver two years in the Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab we developed a sustainable process for running experiments by trying methods out until they (mostly) worked for us. In this session,  we’ll talk about the essential building blocks of our process, take it for a test run, and invite others to share methods they’ve used in their newsrooms. \n\nThe Mobile Lab’s methodology on its surface is pretty simple: \n* draw a line between an idea and an actual hypothesis\n* define success metrics based on all aspects of a user’s experience\n* implement precise analytics\n* survey your audience about how things went\n* have a “burndown” meeting with the entire team to discuss results and insights\n\nThe hard part, we admit, is putting this all together and not losing steam. \n\nFeel free to bring a news experiment idea you want to put through the paces, or we’ll have a few on file to suggest (Obituaries newsletter, anyone?!)",

But how does the public know when meetings are happening? It isn’t easy! These events are spread across dozens of websites, rarely in useful data formats.\n\nThat’s why we're working with a team of civic coders to develop and coordinate the #CityScrapers, a community open source project designed to standardize, scrape and share these meetings in a central database, in collaboration with City Bureau's Documenters program. \n\nAre you working on issues related to governmental transparency, civic tech and journalism?

In addition to being more eye-catching than a traditional text story, they can also simplify complex ideas and be adapted to several other mediums, like print, advertisements, etc. This session is a workshop on making a comic based on a narrative. Participants can bring examples of text stories from their newsrooms and see how it can be adapted to a comic or how a comic could be supplementary content to that story. Together we will explore how to break down a narrative into different panels and optimal ways to convey information through the combination of illustration and text.",

Yet, there are much larger, arguably more scalable media subscription businesses looming overhead: Spotify made $4.6 billion from Premium subscriptions alone in 2017, while Netflix made $11.7 billion and Amazon's numerous subscription verticals raked in $3.2 billion in the same time period.\n\nOne can make a rigorous case that online news sites are now competing directly with these gargantuan media brands for share of users’ time, energy and money. But should music and video streaming services really be the new benchmark for all of media?\n\nThrough a series of interactive activities, we'll dive into what journalists could learn from the Spotify/Netflix/Amazon model about building experiences that foster both participation and loyalty with readers and subscribers—and where that model might fall short for news. We invite participants to bring their own examples of this strategic cross-pollination from their own organizations, which we'll workshop in small groups with visual, design-oriented exercises (read: many Post-it notes!).\n\nOn a higher level, our goal is take a serious, hands-on look at what the phrase \"media convergence\" really means and whether it's a truly viable future for the news business, with streaming as our lens.",

It's ridiculously time-intensive for a few people on the team, but 1,000% worth it.\n\nLike-minded news nerds like Brittany Mayes (NPR) and Sisi Wei (ProPublica) have spoken eloquently about their efforts for internships and fellowships.  SRCCON audiences have been appreciative and very attentive, which means there's more to pursue on the topic.  Few teams can spare the time, but we have a window available _now_ for getting well ahead of any given news org's \"rebooted\" corporate recruiting and hiring efforts.  News nerd teams can cut the trail by adopting hiring practices that truly put our shared ideals front and center, as a demonstration for newsroom and technology groups.\n\nNYT's Interactive News will soon have four full-time hires worth of investment in refining our revamped hiring practices, which have moved us from unambitious box-ticking to some ridiculously hard debates about terrifyingly talented finalists.  Simultaneously, we are actively building a strong recruiting operation for future open positions.  (And my in-house \"expertise\" — aka, firm opinions and elaborate spreadsheets — have resulted in me being part of initiatives to shift the NYT's Technology hiring, too.)  There's a lot to share in that...with co-presenters I think.",

Inspired by the work of Mona Chalabi (who uses hand-drawn visualizations to make her work more accessible), Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi (who embarked on a year-long personal data collection postcard project which became the book Dear Data), and Jose Duarte (of Handmade Visuals), we will play with color, shape, size, and texture. \n\nI'll provide some supplies, but you're welcome to bring your own!
