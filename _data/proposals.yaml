We wrote The SQL Song to help one group of boot camp attendees understand the order of commands. In an attempt to help students fine-tune their programs, we did a game show called Query Cash. To make string functions make more sense, we’ve created silly, but useful performances. To make this session interactive, we propose inviting attendees to bring their ideas. We also will pose some problems and have teams work out creative solutions.",

But how does the public know when meetings are happening? It isn’t easy! These events are spread across dozens of websites, rarely in useful data formats.\n\nThat’s why we're working with a team of civic coders to develop and coordinate the #CityScrapers, a community open source project designed to standardize, scrape and share these meetings in a central database, in collaboration with City Bureau's Documenters program. \n\nAre you working on issues related to governmental transparency, civic tech and journalism? Join us for a hands on session, stay for lessons on creating a more perfect democracy.",

Swarming is not a new concept; Many agile teams often swarm on a story to finish it before moving on to a new story. We took the definition of swarming and made it or own: We don’t just swarm to finish what has already been started, we swarm as soon as we start something new. And we’ve become more productive and collaborative as a result.",

In addition to being more eye-catching than a traditional text story, they can also simplify complex ideas and be adapted to several other mediums, like print, advertisements, etc. This session is a workshop on making a comic based on a narrative. Participants can bring examples of text stories from their newsrooms and see how it can be adapted to a comic or how a comic could be supplementary content to that story. Together we will explore how to break down a narrative into different panels and optimal ways to convey information through the combination of illustration and text.",

In this session we discuss the challenges and barriers that might prevent someone from becoming one of the rare hybrids who mixes traditional reporting with coding and digital development, or the difficulties presented to someone already working in that space.\n\nWhether it's organizational culture, technological challenges, education, lack of time, resources or opportunity or whatever else is standing in your way, we openly share our experiences from both sides of the tracks.",

It's ridiculously time-intensive for a few people on the team, but 1,000% worth it.\n\nLike-minded news nerds like Brittany Mayes (NPR) and Sisi Wei (ProPublica) have spoken eloquently about their efforts for internships and fellowships.  SRCCON audiences have been appreciative and very attentive, which means there's more to pursue on the topic.  Few teams can spare the time, but we have a window available _now_ for getting well ahead of any given news org's \"rebooted\" corporate recruiting and hiring efforts.  News nerd teams can cut the trail by adopting hiring practices that truly put our shared ideals front and center, as a demonstration for newsroom and technology groups.\n\nNYT's Interactive News will soon have four full-time hires worth of investment in refining our revamped hiring practices, which have moved us from unambitious box-ticking to some ridiculously hard debates about terrifyingly talented finalists.  Simultaneously, we are actively building a strong recruiting operation for future open positions.  (And my in-house \"expertise\" — aka, firm opinions and elaborate spreadsheets — have resulted in me being part of initiatives to shift the NYT's Technology hiring, too.)  There's a lot to share in that...with co-presenters I think.",

Along the way, they increase their visibility, credibility, and earnings. What could that look like for the journalism-tech community? For example, a “news nerd” version of a traditional foreign correspondent could uncover datasets abroad, figure out ways to engage the local community, or deploy hardware sensors to track environmental conditions.\n\nWe’ll first talk about all the different kinds of skills we bring to newsrooms. Then we’ll spend some time interviewing each other before we create out-of-the-box job descriptions we can get excited about.",

It's easy to make excuses: we're on deadline, or visual content wouldn't work in a screen reader anyway. But what if it's far easier than you think?
