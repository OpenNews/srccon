We’re interested in everything from photo/illustration, graphics, interactives, and online audio productions. We’ll share a few examples for inspiration to kick off discussion, but we’re mainly interested in hearing from everyone how they keep generate ideas and how they read drafts for potential. How do you think about the visual purpose? E.g. visuals as evidence, for empathy, or an emotional journey? We also want to hear everyone’s favorite tactics for visual research: how to get the visuals or the information to make them, from crowd-sourcing, open datasets, records requests, Google Earth, to interview tips. Finally, as we all know, visual stories tend to take more time than standard stories. What’s your process? How does your newsroom think about planning, setting expectations, and scoping (and the fact that it’s possible to rush edit a half-finished text into publishable form in a day if needed but not possible to hack a half-finished code project into functional form in a day)?",

        "description": "A guide to supporting journalism in a journalism adjacent capacity. Everyone can help improve and solidify journalism even if they aren't a journalist. Actually, we NEED people outside of newsrooms to enrich journalism. This session will explore how you can support the journalism world and why it's crucial for these support structures to exist in order to make journalism better. Some examples: promoting open data and transparency, building tools, technically supporting solo developers in newsrooms, build opportunities for collaborations, provide resources to smaller newsrooms, writing guides, and so much more!",
