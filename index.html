</header>
<p>We'll spend most of the two days in peer-to-peer sessions built around conversation and collaboration—no slides, no presentations, no lectures. We'll also have a bonus evening round of short talks and conversations focused on extracurricular interests and individual obsessions, as well as plenty of opportunities for freeform hallway conversations and socializing in Philadelphia's walkable, bar- and restaurant-packed Old City.

<p>Registration opens in late May, and tickets will cost $150. Proposals for sessions are open through June 9th, and if you're planning to attend SRCCON, you should consider [pitching a session].
