<h2>We are OpenNews</h2>      
<p>We're helping a global network of developers, journalists, makers, and hackers collaborate on innovative code and new ideas. We believe a community of peers working, learning, and solving problems together can create the tools journalism needs to thrive on the open web. Here's how:
      <h3>Fellowships</h3>
      <p>Knight-Mozilla Fellows spend 10 months embedded in partner newsrooms. They are <a href="/fellowships/info.html">paid</a> to work with the community inside and outside of their newsroom to develop and share open-source projects that help to transform journalism on the web. <a href="/fellowships">Learn more.</a>
</p>

<h3>Code</h3>
<p>We believe the <a href="/code.html">code</a> that's being written in journalism today is transformative to the web itself. At OpenNews, we are helping create open-source tools like data visualization libraries, election data parsers, and civic data scrapers that fill real-world needs in newsrooms around the globe.  <a href="/code.html">Here's how.</a></p>

<h3>Hack Days</h3>
<p>We sponsor hack days across the globe to write code and build community and momentum around creating technical solutions to problems that working journalists face. <a href="/hackdays.html">Start hacking.</a>
</p>
      <h3>Source</h3>
      <p>We run <a href="http://source.opennews.org/">Source</a> as a centerpoint for the code being written throughout the journalism community. From features that give the context behind the code, to an index of the community making it, Source is dedicated to presenting the people and projects behind journalism code. <a href="http://source.opennews.org/">Visit now.</a></p>
      
      <h3>Community</h3>
      <p>The hacker-journalist community is a vibrant one, and we love helping it grow in size as well as strength. A diverse array of skills and experiences in technology are necessary to tackle the challenges facing journalism, and we're excited about bringing new people into this community. We want to engage the community at every step, that means we need your help. <a href="/getinvolved.html">Get involved.</a>
