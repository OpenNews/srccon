<p class="bodybig">SRCCON is a conference for developers, interactive designers, and other people who love to code in and near newsrooms. Spend two days in collaboration with some of journalism-code's best thinkers and makers, sketching, planning, and building together.</p>
<p>Join us for two days in peer-to-peer sessions built around conversation and collaboration—no slides, no presentations, no lectures. SRCCON will also have a bonus evening round of short talks and conversations focused on extracurricular interests and individual obsessions, as well as plenty of opportunities for freeform hallway conversations. <a href="/register">Registration</a> opens in late May, and tickets will cost $150.

<p>Sessions will be designed with an eye toward continuing work and conversations through SRCCON and after. We expect themes to develop across sessions and are eager to support connections between groups, so please <a href="mailto:source@mozillafoundation.org">let us know</a> if there's someone who should be involved in SRCCON who we may not already know.
