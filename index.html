<p class="bodybig">This should say something here.
</p>

<p>All SRCCON tickets are now sold out. We welcome ticket-holders to two days of peer-to-peer sessions built around conversation and collaboration—no slides, no presentations, no lectures. For a sneak peek at the program, <a href="/sessions">check out the list of accepted sessions</a>. SRCCON will also have a bonus evening round of short talks and conversations focused on extracurricular interests and individual obsessions, as well as plenty of opportunities for freeform hallway conversations.

<p>Sessions will be designed with an eye toward continuing work and conversations through SRCCON and after. We expect themes to develop across sessions and are eager to support connections between groups, so please <a href="mailto:source@mozillafoundation.org">let us know</a> if there&rsquo;s someone who should be involved in SRCCON who we may not already know.
