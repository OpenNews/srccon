      <p>If you want to attend SRCCON, we don’t want cost to prevent you from coming, which is why we work to keep ticket prices low. To help defray the cost of attending SRCCON, OpenNews is now offering a limited number of $500 travel scholarships. <strong>Scholarship applications are now closed for 2015</strong> and we will notify all applicants by April 28. </p>

<p>Whether you’re a newsroom developer at a small organization with a strained professional development budget or a freelance developer eager to learn more about journalism code, we want to help you attend SRCCON.</p>

<h3 id="what-wersquore-offering">What we’re offering</h3>
<p>$500 for you to use toward the cost of travel for SRCCON.</p>

<h3 id="who-should-apply">Who should apply</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Anyone who is part of the journalism code community</li>
  <li>Anyone interested in learning more about the journalism code community</li>
  <li>Women and other underrepresented groups in technology are strongly encouraged to apply</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-happens-after-you-apply">What happens after you apply</h3>
<p>We’ll review your application and get back to you by April 28.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-after-srccon">What happens after SRCCON</h3>
<p>You tell us how it went! We’ll send you a short follow up survey and will be excited to check out any blog posts or code repos that come out of your participation at SRCCON.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-you-offering-this-scholarship">Why are you offering this scholarship?</h3>
<p>We want to make sure that SRCCON is an event that includes the diversity of the communities we serve—geographically, demographically, experentially, and more. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-decide-who-will-receive-a-scholarship">How do you decide who will receive a scholarship?</h3>
<p>OpenNews staff will review the applications. We will prioritize applications from people underrepresented in the journalism code community as well as from people who would be unable to attend the event without the scholarship.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-still-need-to-purchase-a-ticket-to-srccon">Do I still need to purchase a ticket to SRCCON?</h3>
<p>If you receive a scholarship, you will not have to purchase a ticket. We will notify you about the status of your application the day before tickets go on sale.</p>

<h3 id="when-will-i-hear-if-i-will-receive-a-scholarship">When will I hear if I will receive a scholarship?</h3>
<p>We will notify all scholarship applicants on April 28.</p>

<h3 id="when-will-i-receive-my-scholarship">When will I receive my scholarship?</h3>
<p>When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship. You will need to send us an invoice and our administrators will process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-i-need-more-than-500-for-my-travel">What if I need more than $500 for my travel?</h3>
<p>We’re able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. If travel costs remain an insurmountable obstacle to you with that amount of support, let us know <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WTfx-HwVbN92OZYh6u8t27zPyAUjz7cZ3IOLAwroFIo/viewform">in the application</a>. Also, feel free to contact us with <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#101;&#114;&#105;&#107;&#097;&#064;&#109;&#111;&#122;&#105;&#108;&#108;&#097;&#102;&#111;&#117;&#110;&#100;&#097;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">any feedback</a> on the scholarship process.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-other-ways-i-can-cover-the-cost-of-my-travel">What are other ways I can cover the cost of my travel?</h3>
<p>Luckily, Minneapolis is a relatively cheap city once you arrive. Also, this entire site is a <a href="https://github.com/OpenNews/srccon">GitHub pages repo</a>, so if you say, wanted to add a link to a room-share board, you could go right ahead and do that. Or, you can <a href="erika@mozillafoundation.org">email with any suggestions</a>.</p>
