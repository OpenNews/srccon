            <p class="big-lead">We don&rsquo;t want cost to prevent you from coming to SRCCON, which is why we work to keep ticket prices low. To help defray the cost of attending SRCCON, OpenNews offers a limited number of travel scholarships.</p>

<h1 id="scholarships-for-srccon-2018">Scholarships for SRCCON 2018</h1>

<p>Whether you’re a newsroom developer at a small organization with a strained professional development budget or a freelance developer eager to learn more about journalism code, we want to help you attend SRCCON.</p>

<p>You do not have to fill out a separate application to apply. Scholarship questions are part of our call for participation form, which closed on April 20.</p>

<h2 id="what-wersquore-offering">What We’re Offering</h2>
<p>A ticket to SRCCON and $500 for you to use toward the cost of travel to the event. (For scholarship recipients who live in the Minneapolis area, we offer a SRCCON ticket without the additional travel funding.)</p>

<h2 id="who-should-apply">Who Should Apply</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Anyone who is part of the journalism code community</li>
  <li>Anyone interested in learning more about the journalism code community</li>
  <li>People of color, women, and other under-represented groups in technology are strongly encouraged to apply</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-apply">How to Apply</h2>
<p>The application closed on April 20. When it was open, you could select the “Would you like to be considered for a SRCCON scholarship?” option on the application call for participation form. A few scholarship-specific questions will pop onto the form.</p>

<h2 id="when-notifications-go-out">When Notifications Go Out</h2>
<p>Notifications for scholarships will go out alongisde other notifications as part of the call for participation. Everyone will hear back by April 30.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-after-srccon">What Happens After SRCCON</h2>
<p>You tell us how it went! We’ll send you a short followup survey and will be excited to check out any blog posts or code repos that come out of your participation at SRCCON.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-you-offering-this-scholarship">Why Are You Offering This Scholarship?</h2>
<p>We want to make sure that SRCCON is an event that includes the diversity of the communities we serve—geographically, demographically, experientially, and more. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-decide-who-will-receive-a-scholarship">How Do You Decide Who Will Receive a Scholarship?</h2>
<p>OpenNews staff reviews all applications. We prioritize applications from members of communities under-represented in journalism and technology and from smaller and non-coastal newsrooms.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-still-need-to-purchase-a-ticket-to-srccon">Do I Still Need to Purchase a Ticket to SRCCON?</h2>
<p>If you receive a scholarship, you will not have to purchase a ticket.</p>

<h2 id="when-will-i-receive-my-scholarship">When Will I Receive My Scholarship?</h2>
<p>When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship funds. In short, you will need to fill out a form and send some tax paperwork for our administrators to process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-need-more-than-500-for-my-travel">What If I Need More Than $500 for My Travel?</h2>
<p>We’re able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. Luckily, Minneapolis is a relatively cheap city once you arrive. Also, this entire site runs <a href="https://github.com/OpenNews/srccon">off a Github repo</a>, so if you say, wanted to add a link to a room-share board, you could go right ahead and do that. Or, you can <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#101;&#114;&#105;&#107;&#097;&#064;&#111;&#112;&#101;&#110;&#110;&#101;&#119;&#115;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">email with any suggestions</a>.</p>

            <h3>About SRCCON events</h3>
            <p>OpenNews runs several journalism events each year. The largest is this conference: SRCCON, a mid-year conference for about 300 developers, designers, and data analysts. We also gather small working groups and convenings, and in 2017 added our first topically focused SRCCON-style event, <a href="https://work.srccon.org">SRCCON:WORK</a> in Philadelphia.</p>
