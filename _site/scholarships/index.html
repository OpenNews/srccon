<p class="bodybig">If you want to attend SRCCON, we don&rsquo;t want cost to keep you from coming. We want to make sure that anyone who wants to attend has the opportunity to get together in person to chat and collaborate. To help defray the cost of attending SRCCON, OpenNews is now offering a limited number of $500 travel scholarships, thanks to a generous sponsorship from <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.</p>

    <div class="col">
        <h3>Apply for a scholarship</h3>
        <p>We&rsquo;re accepting applications for a limited number of scholarships until June 13.</p>
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NCN-lonwuSkPY25B-26ju8YQucgkF4Vqtuks41nrdbI/viewform" class="button">Apply now</a>

<p>Whether you’re a newsroom developer at a small organization with a strained professional development budget or a freelance developer eager to learn more about journalism code, we want to help you attend SRCCON.</p>

<h3 id="what-wersquore-offering">What we’re offering</h3>
<p>$500 for you to use toward the cost of travel and registration for SRCCON.</p>

<h3 id="who-should-apply">Who should apply?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Anyone who is part of the journalism code community</li>
  <li>Anyone interested in learning more about the journalism code community</li>
  <li>Women and other under-represented groups in technology are strongly encouraged to apply</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-happens-after-you-apply">What happens after you apply?</h3>
<p>We’ll review your application and get back to you by June 18.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-after-srccon">What happens after SRCCON?</h3>
<p>You tell us how it went! We’ll send you a short follow up survey and will be excited to check out any blog posts or code repos that come out of your participation at SRCCON.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-you-offering-this-scholarship">Why are you offering this scholarship?</h3>
<p>We want to make sure that SRCCON is an event that includes the diversity of the communities we serve—geographically, demographically, experentially, and more. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-decide-who-will-receive-a-scholarship">How do you decide who will receive a scholarship?</h3>
<p>OpenNews staff will review the applications. We will prioritize applications from people under-represented in the journalism code community as well as from people who would be unable to attend the event without the scholarship.</p>

<h3 id="when-will-i-hear-if-i-will-receive-a-scholarship">When will I hear if I will receive a scholarship?</h3>
<p>We will notify all scholarship applicants on June 18.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-still-need-to-purchase-a-ticket-to-srccon">Do I still need to purchase a ticket to SRCCON?</h3>
<p>Yes, everyone attending SRCCON needs to purchase a ticket. Scholarship recipients who have not yet purchased a ticket will have a chance to do so in late in June. (This will be a very limited number  of tickets—please don’t apply for a travel scholarship as a way to get a ticket.)</p>

<h3 id="when-will-i-receive-my-scholarship">When will I receive my scholarship?</h3>
<p>When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship. You will need to send us an invoice and our administrators will process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-i-need-more-than-500-for-my-travel">What if I need more than $500 for my travel?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, we are only able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. This is our first time offering these scholarships, so we needed to start with a simple set-up, but we appreciate <a href="erika@mozillafoundation.org">any feedback</a> on the process.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-other-ways-i-can-cover-the-cost-of-my-travel">What are other ways I can cover the cost of my travel?</h3>
<p>Luckily, Philadelphia is a relatively cheap city once you arrive. There is a hostel around the corner from the venue, and many other cheap accommodations and food options. Also, this entire site is a <a href="https://github.com/sinker/srccon">GitHub pages repo</a>, so if you say, wanted to add a link to a room-share board, you could go right ahead and do that. Or, you can <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#101;&#114;&#105;&#107;&#097;&#064;&#109;&#111;&#122;&#105;&#108;&#108;&#097;&#102;&#111;&#117;&#110;&#100;&#097;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">email with any suggestions</a>.</p>
