            <p class="big-lead">We don&rsquo;t want cost to prevent you from coming to SRCCON, which is why we work to keep ticket prices low. To help defray the cost of attending, OpenNews offers a limited number of travel scholarships.</p>

<h1 id="scholarships-for-srccon-2019">Scholarships for SRCCON 2019</h1>

<p>Whether you’re a newsroom developer at a small organization with a strained professional development budget or a freelance developer eager to learn more about journalism code, we want to help you attend SRCCON.</p>

<p>There’s no separate application—there were questions about scholarships on <a href="/participation/form/">our call for participation form</a>, which closed for scholarship applications on April 24.</p>

<h2 id="what-were-offering">What We’re Offering</h2>

<p>A ticket to SRCCON and $500 for you to use toward the cost of travel to the event. (For scholarship recipients who live in the Minneapolis area, we offer a SRCCON ticket without the additional travel funding.)</p>

<p>In addition to the travel scholarships, for the first time this year, we’re offering one scholarship of $500 for caretaking-related costs. (Either to bring your loved ones to Minneapolis, or help care for them back home while you’re at the conference.) There is a separate question on the call for participation form to apply for this scholarship.</p>

<h2 id="who-should-apply">Who Should Apply</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Anyone who is part of the journalism code community</li>
  <li>Anyone interested in learning more about the journalism code community</li>
  <li>People of color, women, and other underrepresented groups in technology are strongly encouraged to apply</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-apply">How to Apply</h2>
<p>The application was part of our <a href="/participation/form/">call for participation form</a>. The deadline to apply for a scholarship was April 24.</p>

<h2 id="when-notifications-go-out">When Notifications Go Out</h2>
<p>Notifications for scholarships will go out alongside other notifications as part of the call for participation. You’ll hear from us by May 10.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-after-srccon">What Happens After SRCCON</h2>
<p>You tell us how it went! We’ll send you a short followup survey and will be excited to check out anything you write or build coming out of your participation at SRCCON.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-you-offering-this-scholarship">Why Are You Offering This Scholarship?</h2>
<p>We want to make sure that SRCCON is an event that includes the diversity of the communities we serve—geographically, demographically, experientially, and more. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-decide-who-will-receive-a-scholarship">How Do You Decide Who Will Receive a Scholarship?</h2>
<p>OpenNews staff reviews all applications. We prioritize applications from members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology and from smaller and non-coastal newsrooms.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-still-need-to-purchase-a-ticket-to-srccon">Do I Still Need to Purchase a Ticket to SRCCON?</h2>
<p>If you receive a scholarship, you will not have to purchase a ticket.</p>

<h2 id="when-will-i-receive-my-scholarship">When Will I Receive My Scholarship?</h2>
<p>When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship funds. In short, you will need to fill out a form and send some tax paperwork for our administrators to process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-need-more-than-500-for-my-travel">What If I Need More Than $500 for My Travel?</h2>
<p>We’re able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. Luckily, Minneapolis is a relatively cheap city once you arrive. Also, this entire site runs <a href="https://github.com/OpenNews/srccon">off a Github repo</a>, so if you, say, wanted to add a link to a room-share board, you could go right ahead and do that! Or, you can <a href="mailto:srccon@opennews.org">email with any suggestions</a>.</p>
