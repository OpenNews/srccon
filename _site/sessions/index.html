<p>The program at SRCCON is built around hands-on, participatory sessions, <a href="/program">and also makes space</a> for emergent conversations, evening activities, and time to talk with the people you meet. Our <a href="https://schedule.srccon.org">conference schedule for 2019</a> is built from the sessions listed here.</p>

<p>We have a few sessions and facilitators still to confirm, and some descriptions here may evolve between now and SRCCON. Thank you to everyone who submitted proposals, and to the <a href="#community-review">community panel</a> that helped us during the review process!</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Facilitated by <a href="https://twitter.com/katiepark">Katie Park</a> &amp; Alex Tatusian</p>
        <p class="session-description"><p>Sometimes the well of ideas runs dry and we find ourselves stuck in a creative rut. If we can’t move past it, let’s try thinking sideways. Drawing inspiration from Peter Schmidt and Brian Eno’s Oblique Strategies, a card-based system that offers pithy prompts for creative thinking, we’ll discuss ways to shift our perspective in the process of brainstorming, designing and problem-solving. Some of Schmidt and Eno’s one-line strategies include:</p>

<p>“Not building a wall but making a brick.”
“Go to an extreme, move back to a more comfortable place.”
“You can only make one dot at a time.”</p>

<p>As a group, we’ll look at projects that emerged from unconventional sources of inspiration, share our favorite methods of breaking creative block and then develop our own list of “oblique strategies” that we’ll publish online after the session.</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>The 2020 census is a year away, but chances are you’ve already heard about it. The census is making headlines because several states are suing the Trump administration over its plans to include a citizenship question. But much of the news glosses over why the census is important and how it affects everyone’s lives. Congressional representation is at stake, along with $800 billion in federal funds that will get disbursed for state, county, and community programs over the next decade.</p>

<p>When KPCC conducted human-centered design research into the census and the opportunities for public service journalism, one finding stood out: We can’t assume educated news consumers know the stakes or the mechanics of the census. There was a very low level of census knowledge among the people we interviewed, including current NPR listeners. How can we address this knowledge gap? We have some ideas. Let’s talk.</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>In a post-Gamergate world, how should we think about personal data in our reporting and our research? What responsibilities do we have to the privacy of the communities we report on? While many journalists have <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T71OE4fm4ns0ugEOmKOY4xF4H9ikbebmikv96sgi16A/edit">struggled with this question</a>, few newsrooms have an explicit ethics policy on how they retain, release, and redact personally-identifiable information. Let’s change that, by drafting a sample PII ethics policy that can be adopted by organizations both large and small.</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>Conferences may be educational and inspirational for you, but also expanding value to your team and organization should be at the top of your mind. Having a process to help in preparing, attending, and post-event knowledge sharing can help focus your attention to maximize the time you spend at conferences. In this session, we will define the common types of conference attendees and map to activities before, during, and after conferences to provide a solid framework for making conferences a must-fund part of your team’s budget. If you’ve ever come back from an event inspired and excited, but unsure how to take the next step, this session is for you.</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>It’s often assumed there’s a difference between being part of an innovation team and working a beat in a traditional newsroom setting. There is much that is transferable between the two jobs. This session would explore similarities between two seemingly different functions in the modern newsroom and try to answer the following questions:  How do you bring the level of exploration and experimentation to your beat? What lessons might folks with a product manager/design background be able to share with fellow journalists to make the return easier?</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>We have an obligation to our teams and our companies to bring great new people into our work who can help push our teams forward, and yet interviewing candidates can feel extracurricular and rote. We need to discuss what we might be doing wrong, what the consequences are, and how to better focus our efforts when we are interviewing the people who want to work alongside us.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about how to create safe and respectful spaces in a job interview. Let’s think deeply and critically about how we spend the thirty to sixty minutes we have in the company of potential colleagues to ensure we’re learning the right things, in the right ways, for the right reasons. Let’s discuss different approaches to  advocating for a candidate you believe in, finding the person behind the candidate, questioning unconscious bias as you observe it, and teaching others how to do likewise.</p>

<p>This session is designed for both for seasoned interviewers and folks who have never done it before. Using actual interviews as a practice space and group discussion about foibles and tactics, we hope to walk away from this session with renewed focus and better, more respectful tools for getting to know a potential colleague and doing the hard work of bringing them into our newsrooms.</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>In this session, we’ll collaboratively create ways to help folks from historically privileged backgrounds be better allies to their colleagues from minority and marginalized backgrounds. The goal is to advocate for fair and comprehensive coverage and a more inclusive newsroom culture. The method by which we get that done is up to us, but will aim to result in a community that continues beyond SRCCON.</p>

<p>It’s time for the people with privilege to do the hard work of making things right. This might be a messy and awkward process, but our work, our workplaces and our lives will be better for it.</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>Being a journalist is hard these days and awards aren’t a bad thing. But data I’ve compiled shows that the best work of the year is often backloaded into November and December, when most contest deadlines come due.  But this is also likely the least ideal time for big impactful work to come out as regular people and those with power to effectuate change leave work for the holidays. Let’s have a discussion about how we can change that, to be able to fete our peers while also remaining true to our mission.</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>Teaching data journalism in newsrooms and at universities has forced us to come up with creative techniques.

To make string functions make more sense, we’ve created silly, but useful performances. To make this session interactive, we propose inviting attendees to bring their ideas. We also will pose some problems and have teams work out creative solutions.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Facilitated by <a href="https://twitter.com/tylrfishr">Tyler Fisher</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/BritRenee_">Brittany Mayes</a></p>
        <p class="session-description"><p>Over the past few decades, newsroom technologists have pushed the field of journalism forward in countless ways. As we approach a new decade, and arguably a new era of digital journalism, how must newsroom technologists evolve to meet new needs? And how do we center technology in a newsroom while also fixing the problems news organizations have long had regarding diversity, representing their communities, speaking to their audiences, etc.?</p>

<p>In this session, we will start with a set of hypotheses to seed discussion.</p>

<p>For journalism to succeed in the next decade:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Newsroom technologists must have real power in their organizations.</li>
  <li>Experimentation and product development must be central to how a newsroom operates.</li>
  <li>News organizations must be radically inclusive of their communities.</li>
  <li>Cultivating positive culture and interpersonal relationships is key to developing sustainable newsrooms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given these hypotheses, what skills do we need to grow in newsroom technologists? What must we think about more deeply in our daily work? What tools do we need to develop? How must this community evolve? Together, let’s brainstorm these questions and leave with ideas to explore and deepen newsroom technology and culture beyond SRCCON.</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>Writing good documentation is hard, so let’s write some together in a low-pressure environment! This session isn’t just about writing documentation to go with SRCCON; it’s an opportunity to learn how to improve documentation at your organization and perhaps take-away a prototype install of Library, too.</p>

<p>We’ll start by collaborating on successful approaches to writing and sharing documentation in a newsroom, then use Library to collect useful documentation for all SRCCON attendees.</p>

<p>Library is an open-source documentation tool released by the New York Times in collaboration with Northwestern University’s Knight Lab earlier this year. Because every page in Library is a Google Doc, you already know how to use it!</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>[cue Star Wars scroll …]</p>

<p>Heading into 2019, Chicago faced a historic election. For the first time in decades, the mayor’s office was up for grabs with no incumbent and no heir apparent to the 5th floor of City Hall. Meanwhile, the clerk, treasurer and entire 50-seat City Council were up for election. Competition was fierce.</p>

<p>Small newsrooms faced the daunting task of covering all of these races. More than 200 candidates were running for local office – including more than a dozen for mayor – from complete unknowns to career pols. All of this was taking place in a news environment where media often struggles to engage voters and help them make informed decisions.</p>

<p>With these challenges in mind, a group of five local independent newsrooms decided to pool their resources and work together to create a one-stop resource to serve voters. In a matter of days, the Chi.vote Collaborative was founded, launching a website with candidate profiles, articles, voter resources and other information. The collaborative grew to 10 partners and traffic to the website surged heading into the February election and eventual April runoff. We literally built the car as we drove it, rolling out new features as fast as we could develop them. All while publishing new stories and information daily.</p>

<p>We quickly learned a lot about collaborating, building on each other’s strengths and overcoming challenges. Here are our takeaways, what worked and what didn’t, along with tips, insights and all the key technical details that could help you and your collaborators cover the next election.</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>Incidents and outages are a normal part of any complex system. In recent years The New York Times adopted a collaborative method for discussing these events called Learning Reviews. We’d like to give a brief introduction to Learning Reviews—where they originated, why they’re called Learning Reviews, what they are—followed by a few exercises with the attendees. Some of these group exercises would focus on communicating the idea of complexity and how that impacts our ability to predict the future. In doing so, we’d also communicate how complex systems have a degree of impermanence and how this contributes to outages. This segues into the theme of the discussion, how do we look back on an event in a way that prioritizes learning more about our systems and less about finding fault with a human? We’ll go over the importance of language and facilitation in this process.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Facilitated by <a href="https://twitter.com/phihado">Phi Do</a></p>
        <p class="session-description"><p>Screenwriters use many techniques to distribute information throughout a film: building context to create goals and desires, withholding knowledge to create intrigue, planting clues to create suspense, and revealing discoveries to create surprise. By establishing rhythms of expectation, anticipation, disappointment, and fulfillment, a well-written screenplay keeps us captivated as it directs us through all the plot points and to the heart of the story.</p>

<p>Data journalism shares a similar goal. Are there lessons from screenwriting we can use to write engaging, data-driven stories, so we don’t end up with an info dump? Let’s find out together.</p>

<p>In this session, we’ll participate in a writers’ room to discuss how screenwriters use different strategies to jam-pack information into scenes while building a narrative and keeping pace. Then we’ll try out different screenwriting approaches to see how we can best break down complex data sets in our reporting, guide readers to the story, and keep their attention. Wipe down the whiteboards, grab some Post-its, and let’s break some stories!</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>We are all too aware that the 2020 election is coming up. But do our community members feel empowered by the coverage we’re producing? Unlikely. Typically it starts with the candidates and what they have to do to win, rather than the voters and what they need to participate. We should flip that.</p>

<p>If we let the needs of community members drive the design of our election coverage, it would look dramatically different – and be dramatically better for our democratic process and social cohesion, we think. Bonus: those community members will be pretty grateful to you for unsexy coverage like explaining what a circuit court judge does. At a time when we’re pivoting to reader revenue, this public service journalism model is not just good karma – it should be seen as mission critical.</p>

<p>We’ll explore the “jobs to be done” in election reporting, how to ask questions that will give you a deeper understanding of voters’ information needs, the tools at our disposal to do that, and the ways that newsrooms can ensure they have enough feedback from actual voters to resist the siren call of the latest campaign gaffe or poll results.</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>Too often, tips and suggestions for email newsletters at newsrooms can take a “one size fits all” approach. We’ve seen that the way a newsletter is made at a newsroom can enormously vary based on the size, resources and purpose of any given newsroom.</p>

<p>In this session, we’ll create a card-based strategy game that will guide small groups of participants through the process of creating a new newsletter product that meets an outlet’s editorial and business outcomes. Groups will have to develop a strategy that meets specific goals and will have to overcome hurdles and challenges that we throw in their way.</p>

<p>Throughout the simulation, we’ll present then guide the room through a series of discussion topics and exercises based around the key worksteams of an email newsletter at a newsroom: user research, content creation, workflows, acquiring new email readers, and converting readers to members or donors.</p>

<p>But our brains aren’t what’s broken, they’re working exactly as they evolved to work. Technology has just evolved much, much faster. And that tech is affecting our emotional and physiological well being. Media companies and platforms have capitalized on our innate psychological and neurological vulnerabilities to make money and keep us hooked. But there have to be better ways to build community and share information on the web.

        <p class="session-description"><p>It’s been amazing to see how the news nerd community has grown and evolved over the decades, and as we’ve gotten to meet in person over the last 5 years of SRCCONs. We have data about who is part of the news nerd community, and through various Slacks and events like this one, we’ve seen how members of this community support and care for one another. Let’s take a moment to reflect on this community (with the support of an outside facilitator): who is a part of this community? Who is not (or is not yet) included? What are our responsibilities to each other? What does our collective future hold? We’ll explore what we need to create that future, together.</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>While journalists talk a lot about having an impact, we’re not as forthcoming on how we can be more deliberate and active in informing structural change in our communities. Our work is often geared to spark surface-level outcomes (a law was passed, an official was held accountable, etc.), but even when media organizations are equipped to do deeper investigative work, they often don’t invest in longer-term strategies that can illuminate pathways for citizens to create more equitable, healthy systems.</p>

<p>Using a practice called systems thinking – a holistic approach to grappling with complex issues – journalists can develop more collaborative frameworks that help people build power and resiliency to address some of our most deeply rooted problems. Through the lens of systems thinking, we’ll open a discussion about some of the big ideas and questions that a change-oriented approach holds for journalists: What new roles can journalists play to help evaluate and facilitate opportunities for social change? How do we negotiate traditional journalistic principles and standards while working to actively dismantle oppressive systems? How can we better communicate and act on our values?</p>

<p>We’ll offer ideas from the systems thinking playbook, discuss examples of journalists who are actively rooting their practice in systems change and lead a visioning exercise to imagine new possibilities.</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>There are many resources out there for managers leading remote teams.

There are also plenty of arguments that have been made for how remote work improves employee effectiveness and satisfaction, why it has economic benefits for employers, and on and on.</p>

<p>And yet, national news organizations concentrate their staff in the most expensive cities in the country. Let’s try to figure out why that is and help make the case for supporting a more remote-friendly workforce.</p>

<p>In this session we’ll try to come up with as many of the common objections raised by hiring managers when they insist that a given position be based in a particular location and then come up with a playbook of effective arguments to overcome those objections.</p>

<p>One of the keys early on in the session will be to have people identify themselves as managers and former managers, versus our typical worker-bee reporters. We’ll encourage dialogue between the managers who are willing to talk about their fears and shortcomings, and worker bees who are willing to talk about how they want to be managed.

        <p class="facilitator">Facilitated by <a href="https://twitter.com/lewispants">Lewis Raven Wallace</a></p>
        <p class="session-description"><p>“Parachute journalism” is the practice of national outlets or freelancers flying into local communities they’re not a part of to report a story, then leaving again. It’s a part of our journalistic economy, as the money and power in journalism is focused in just a few geographic locations–but it can also be damaging to local communities, and it can lead to misrepresentation, distrust and resentment. Often, national journalists appear in a community in times of trauma and elections, and report stories with insufficient context, while local journalists struggle to access equivalent resources for necessary ongoing reporting. This session will explore our collective experiences with parachute journalism as both insiders and outsiders to a community, in order to produce good ideas about how to do harm reduction, increase accountability, and shift power dynamics. We’ll ask: Are there situations where it’s better if this story just doesn’t get told? How do we evaluate that? What can national media outlets and freelancers do to connect and collaborate with local journalists and local communities? What are the ethics of accountable partnerships? In what ways do local and regional/national media needs differ, and how can journalists collaborate to produce stories that better address the needs of all involved? All of this will be driving at a larger question: What does justice and accountability look like in the practice of journalism?</p>

At the same time, journalists with a nontraditional mix of skills, who sit at the intersection of roles, departments or teams — we call them platypuses — are proving to be pivotal to the future of news. So how can newsrooms use the people they have to push their digital initiatives forward?</p>

<p>This session brings together digital journalists and managers to discuss career growth within the newsroom, especially for people with a nontraditional blend of skills. A lot of growth in digital careers is uncharted territory, but through our empathy interviews we will bring together tips and frameworks for how digital journalists can fit into forward-thinking newsrooms.</p>

<p>We’ll share success stories and lessons learned, and we’ll workshop tactics that could work in participants’ newsrooms.

        <p class="session-description"><p>A lot of data journalism takes place in front of a computer, but there is a lot to be gained by creating data together with your community.  As part of a documentary project about a culturally diverse, low-income community, we recently invited residents to map their neighborhood — not online, but with paper and pens at in-person gatherings. We not only generated unique data, but also stories and context we never would have heard if we hadn’t met people where they lived.</p>

<p>More and more, journalists are experimenting with community engagement practices to accurately reflect and represent people’s lived experiences. We can do the same by taking an analog approach to creating data, including our community in the stories we tell about them. This helps verify the data by collecting it ourselves and having subject matter experts (your community!) vet it along the way. It also makes our reporting process more transparent and creates a group of people invested in our work.</p>

<p>We’ll share what we did and what we learned in our neighborhood mapping experiments, and invite a discussion on other ways to weave community engagement into data reporting. Our goal: draft a starter kit of ideas for doing data journalism IRL that you can take back to your newsroom.</p>

Our newsroom might have to cover a traumatic event on a larger scale - a mass shooting, a devastating brush fire, hurricane or tornado. We take care to tell the stories of those affected, to make sure their voices and their grief are heard. But we also need to take care of ourselves and our colleagues in these moments. What should you be looking for to make sure you’re protected and feel empowered to speak up for yourself when you don’t feel comfortable or need help?

        <p class="session-description"><p>Diversity initiatives are popping up in most companies these days. Newsrooms are talking about gender and race representation, re-examining how we cover stories and how we create space for employees of all genders and races. We laud ourselves for being aware and being inclusive. However, noticeably missing from the conversation, at least for those who identify as such, are people with disabilities.</p>

<p>The New York Times has employee lead initiatives to help correct that. From the tech task force that turned into a team designated with making our site more accessible, to the internal panel on employees with disabilities that turned into an employee resource group the disabled community and their allies at the times are standing up and taking space.</p>

<p>During this session we will examine how the disability community is represented in newsrooms and institutions, discuss what has been done, and set a framework for how to take action now. We will work together to figure out what ally-ship looks like and what it means for diversity initiatives to include people with disabilities, and how they miss the mark when they don’t – both for employees and our coverage.</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>We often come across percentages in journalism, simple numbers that convey a powerful amount of information. But a percentage can obscure crucial information. If one ZIP code has 30 homeless individuals out of 100, and another has 30,000 homeless out of 100,000, the percentages indicates similarity, but the two geographies will have vastly different times dealing with the homeless population. When looking at a list of percentages, we should endeavor to find those that are distinct. Tools from statistical theory can help us tease out what’s unusual and what isn’t. It doesn’t require much complicated math, just a little algebra.</p>

        <p class="session-description"><p>Many news organizations are investigating how to apply artificial intelligence to the practice of journalism. Meanwhile many individuals and organizations are funding advancements in the field of news and AI. Do we take into consideration unconscious bias when developing algorithms and methods to build these new digital tools? How can they be best applied? What does the application of AI mean for newsrooms and the public they serve?</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Facilitated by <a href="https://twitter.com/anjdelgado">Anjanette Delgado</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/jkteoh">Jun-Kai Teoh</a></p>
        <p class="session-description"><p>How would we do journalism differently if we were to think about impact — real-world change — at the brainstorming stage, before we started to write or shoot? If we knew something needed to happen to make things better, could we identify a few levers to pull that’d make that something more likely? Would we frame the story differently? Share the data openly? Talk to different sources? And how do we do all of this without going too far, without crossing into advocacy journalism? Now more than ever, with more nonprofit newsrooms forming, more for-profit newsrooms turning to consumer revenue (on the sales pitch that journalism matters) and trust at a crisis point, we need to measure and show why our work matters. This session will cover published examples and studies but is meant to be a discussion about what we can do — and what’s going too far — to make a difference. We might also, using design thinking strategies, prototype a project designed for impact.</p>
