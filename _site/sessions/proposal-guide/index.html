<p>There are a lot of ways to think about sessions at SRCCON events. We’ve put this guide together to help you turn your great idea into an equally great proposal.</p>

<p><span id="about-sessions"></span></p>

<h2 id="what-are-sessions-at-srccon-events-like">What are sessions at SRCCON events like?</h2>

<p>SRCCON events are different than many other conferences you may have attended. They’re highly participatory: no panels on a stage or speakers running through 40 minutes of slides. You might notice that we refer to “facilitators” or “session leaders,” because when you run a session at a SRCCON event, you’re in a room with dozens of other smart people with an opportunity to <a href="https://source.opennews.org/articles/srccon-great-conference-sessions/">compare notes, share skills, and help everyone learn from each other</a>.</p>

<p>A few principles lay the groundwork for our programs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SRCCON events are built around participation, discussion, and collaborative problem-solving.</li>
  <li>SRCCON events exist to respond to the needs and interests of our community, and we’re intentional in including perspectives from throughout the field.</li>
  <li>Every attendee is a peer. Conference badges don’t show organizations or speaker status—we’re all here to learn from each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sessions inhabit these values in different ways, through structured discussions and problem-solving groups; peer-to-peer workshops; even games, drawing, or field trips. We avoid traditional lectures and classroom-style trainings, but we welcome your creativity across a range of hands-on and collaborative session styles.</p>

<p><span id="review-process"></span></p>

<h2 id="our-session-review-process">Our session review process</h2>

<p>Our goal for each SRCCON event is to build a conference schedule that responds to the community’s needs in the moment and hopes for the future. Programs are usually a mix of technical workshops, culturally focused discussions, and sessions that exist somewhere in between. As we review proposals, we look for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>topics that are relevant to developers, designers, journalists, and editors in newsrooms</li>
  <li>a session description that shows you’ve thought through your time with attendees</li>
  <li>thoughts about what you’d like participants to take away from your session</li>
</ul>

<p>We also build each program around key community values:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>We experiment in the open</strong>—by sharing our work and processes, we do the innovative work our organizations need to evolve on the web and better inform our audiences.</li>
  <li><strong>We support one another</strong>—by offering each other our expertise and empathy, we find new collaborators, help each other learn, and make our networks and organizations more resilient.</li>
  <li><strong>We lead change</strong>—by challenging the power structures that have failed our industry, we push for inclusive, long-lasting change in our newsrooms, led by journalists of color and the wide community of journalists outside of NYC/DC.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the call for participation closes, the SRCCON team sets aside time to consider session proposals. We also invite a diverse group of community members to provide feedback during the review process. Our priority is to build a balanced program that reflects the entire community, and we actively welcome session proposals from members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology, and from non-coastal, local, and regional news organizations.</p>

<p><span id="great-proposals"></span></p>

<h2 id="what-goes-into-a-great-session-proposal">What goes into a great session proposal?</h2>

<p>Successful sessions at SRCCON events often emerge from a single question or problem—if you’ve been struggling with just about any aspect of your work, you can bet others have dealt with it, too. We don’t recruit topics from a list of trends, we bring them to SRCCON because facilitators are passionate and excited to share.</p>

<p>Your session title and description will be our introduction to what your proposal is all about. We love creative, catchy titles, but the most important quality here is clarity. What questions are you asking? What will people learn how to do? Your session description should tell us how you’ll spend time with participants. We reserve 60-75 minutes for each session, which can be plenty of time to dig into even deep topics—but it does go faster than you think! You can think of your title and description as a short conversation with attendees: Tell people why they might want to join you, what they’ll do while they’re in the room, and what they’ll learn and take home with them.</p>

<p>Effective sessions are about effort and preparation more than expertise. We find that the most promising proposals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take on a topic that can be realistically covered in a little more than an hour</li>
  <li>provide a clear and inviting description of the session</li>
  <li>describe a clear outcome—what people can expect to leave with</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="qualities-that-make-a-session-proposal-stand-out">Qualities that make a session proposal stand out</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Creative formats.</strong> Think about an agenda or <a href="https://2016.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-illustrating-investigations">activity that can draw people in</a> and support learning or sharing.</li>
  <li><strong>An inclusive perspective.</strong> Journalism needs to hear from <a href="https://2016.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-underrepresented-managers">underrepresented communities</a> and <a href="https://2017.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-local-data-journalism">organizations outside</a> the New York-DC corridor. We look for these voices in our session topics and facilitators.</li>
  <li><strong>Topics you don’t often see at traditional conferences.</strong> SRCCON welcomes <a href="https://work.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-mental-health-support">hard conversations</a>, and session topics you <a href="https://2017.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-overcoming-personality-traits">might have never seen</a> on a journalism conference schedule before.</li>
  <li><strong>A plan that helps attendees upgrade their skills.</strong> That might mean learning a <a href="https://2017.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-radio-spectrum">new technique</a> or technology, or <a href="https://2015.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-31">digging deeper</a> into an existing area of expertise.</li>
  <li><strong>A plan that helps attendees expand their peer group.</strong> SRCCON connects people with a <a href="https://2017.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-people-of-color-newsrooms">community of peers</a> they can reach out to for <a href="https://work.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-like-a-boss">collaboration and support</a> down the road.</li>
</ul>

<p><span id="great-session-plans"></span></p>

<h2 id="how-to-plan-a-session-that-works">How to plan a session that works</h2>

<p>SRCCON events are hands-on and collaborative, and it’s hard to participate in a session that’s mostly lecture with a few minutes for discussion. It’s great to start imagining an interesting format for your session now, and tell us about it your proposal. It’s totally OK to set up a session with an intro and a few slides, or to use examples throughout to help people learn, but we do look for pitches that include real interactivity.</p>

<p>Our programs include conversational sessions, where people can discuss questions or problems in a way they often can’t at larger conferences, as well as technical sessions, where people share specific expertise and participants leave with a new skill. Outstanding session formats in previous years have included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>design exercises</li>
  <li>roundtable conversations</li>
  <li>games</li>
  <li>hands-on workshops</li>
  <li>small-group work</li>
  <li>collaborative documentation</li>
  <li>physical movement and field trips</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re always interested in new ideas, too, so feel free to propose something we’ve never imagined!</p>

<p>It’s also useful to think about information and activity density. Over-programming a session can make it impossible to finish in time for the takeaways you planned, but a session that isn’t <em>designed</em> can easily turn into a conversation between a handful of the loudest people. We’re happy to help you figure out the right balance, and we don’t expect you to have all the answers at the pitch stage. (So feel free to ask for feedback, and when in doubt, narrow your scope.)</p>

<h2 id="pitching-with-a-co-facilitator">Pitching with a co-facilitator</h2>

<p>Co-facilitators can share the load of preparing for your session and leading it at the event, as well as the fun of participating in the conference itself. (If you’re comfortable leading a session by yourself, that’s great too!)</p>

<p>Feel free to work on the proposal together, but only one person needs to submit the full session idea in our call for participation form. Co-facilitators can let us know “somebody else has already listed me as a co-facilitator” in the form, and we’ll link everything up.</p>

<p>We consider solo and team proposals alike. But if you feel like your session could benefit from a co-facilitator, we encourage you to consider pitching with someone from another organization, and/or a different background from your own. If you’ve attended SRCCON before, you might even consider proposing with someone who hasn’t been yet. (We don’t reject proposals featuring two members of the same team, two SRCCON alums, etc., but we may favor proposals that mix it up.)</p>

<p>If we see a number of pitches on the same subject, you can bet we’ll make sure it’s represented on the schedule. Sometimes we’ll even suggest that proposers consider joining up to lead a session together as co-facilitators.</p>

  <li><a href="https://2018.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-blind-spots-coverage">Managing the blind spots in community news coverage</a>. Participants worked together on strategies to identify the blind spots in their own newsroom’s coverage, talk about them with decision-makers, and build relationships with underserved communities.</li>
  <li><a href="https://lead.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-reorg-around-product">How to re-org your newsroom around product without breaking it</a>. This session came to two SRCCON events in 2019, helping participants reimagine their org chart, anticipate newsroom needs and questions, and come up with a plan for transformation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tickets-for-facilitators">Tickets for facilitators</h2>

<p>We reserve a ticket for purchase by each facilitator of an accepted session. We don’t provide free tickets for facilitators, but we do offer need-based scholarships that anyone can apply for if they need help covering the costs of attending.</p>

<p>Why do we do it this way? SRCCON events are collaborative and peer-to-peer—we consider all attendees to be active participants, not just speakers or passive audience members. This approach also helps us keep ticket prices as low as we can for a variety of sizes of news organizations.</p>

<p><span id="support"></span></p>

<h2 id="more-ways-we-can-support-you-in-developing-your-session-idea">More ways we can support you in developing your session idea</h2>
