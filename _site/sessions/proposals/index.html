        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/blaine">Blaine Cook</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">I love that SRCCON proposals are open to the public, because with just 1 hour to go before the deadline, I can see that the elephant in the room is money (try searches for "pay", "advert", "money") - there are virtually no talks about how this community can move beyond the terrible display ad optimization, paywalls and grants that many of us depend on for our income. More than that, can (and how) do we make independent journalism, the kind that doesn't thrive on ad impressions, work as a sustainable living, too? Models for money and payments have changed dramatically over the past few years - Spotify, Kickstarter, Patreon, etc., but few of these have made a real impact in the newsroom. Let's think cooperatively, and see what creative approaches the SRCCON community (i.e., not just biz-dev) has up their collective sleeves.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMuyskens">John Muyskens</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Let's talk about the all-important bit of the development process that happens between the spark of an idea and writing the first line of code. A well-honed bootstrapping workflow to create a new project from scratch can save the day in a breaking news situation. But how you start your project can make all the difference whether the deadline is hours or weeks away. Your workflow can not only save you time, but also encourage best practices, ease collaboration and keep you sane. 

We will describe and compare project scaffolding tools, news app templates and web development workflows. We will discuss how to make appropriate technical decisions for your team and project scope. And we will brainstorm features we wish our workflows had. Do you clone or scaffold? How do you manage technical debt and feature-creep? How do you prepare for the future?

Let's share our best ideas for setting up our projects to succeed from the very start.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/arjunasoriano">Arjuna Soriano</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">As a SRCCON attendee you are probably working in journalism and technology, fields that are fueling some of the most significant changes in children's lives today. As journalists and nerds, we are generally thoughtful about most things in our lives, but parenting comes so hard and so fast that it is easy to live in the moment and not create an ethos by which to parent. 

I am personally very granola and severely limit the amount of media and technology in my children's lives, but I don't think that this is the only way to raise children. Let's build a community of parents working in journalism and technology and learn from each other's shared experiences.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/jigyasa_grover">Jigyasa Grover</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Open source projects can attract more people to contribute to them. The numbers are not that good. According to a survey, only 11% of open source participants are women. This can be improved. People find it intimidating to get started with contributing to open source. Why? This talk will back them up by answering questions, throwing light on the issues that they usually have.

The talk aims at introducing the audience to the world f FOSS and elaborate the vast range of opportunities ranging from coding to documentation, design, outreach and research. The speaker shall converse her involvement and  experience in FOSS and its impact. A special emphasis shall be on the dearth of women in technology. It aspires to inspire budding girl developers and showcase women who’ve made significant contributions to technology.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/kavyasukumar">Kavya Sukumar</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">So you or your team is working on an open source project. But is it really open source or just publicly available source?
What are the hallmarks of a great open source project? How can a small news-dev team juggling multiple projects build  products that don't impose your internal branding and assumptions on users outside?
 Come share tips, tricks and learnings from building and maintaining open source tools and products.</p>

        <h2 class="session-title"><a href="#proposal-318698">Get you a CMS that can do both: Platforms, the web, and storytelling imperatives <span class="permalink">&para;</span></a></h2>
        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/tangentialism">David Yee</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Faced with the drive to program to remote partners, apps,  and corporate-owned-and-operated chat platforms, we find ourselves rolling the dice on a future that seems to call for a referendum on The Web. As the tools we use for storytelling become not just more diverse but more constrained by the spectre of Terms Of Service, can we hedge our bets? Or to put it a different way, does our work to serve both third-party platforms and the websites that serve as our foundations actually constitute a zero-sum game? This session proposes that, by stepping back, we can imagine a workflow and toolset that serves both needs—and, by extension, newsrooms—even better than the current generation of content management systems.

In order to investigate this approach, we will ask three questions:

1. Rather than abandon the benefits that the web affords us as a structure, how can we carry with us the ethos and process of the web as we negotiate these new platforms?
2. Can our industry call upon a history of standards and protocols to avoid partner lock-in?
3. Should our tools pivot from a focus on authorship to one of reportage and remixing, allowing us to use new platforms in focused ways without losing control over the source material?

What if the web is the best idea? How can we retain the imperatives of the web as we serve the future of storytelling, and what are the kinds of tools and standards we can rally around to preserve that context while allowing us to experiment in other people's walled gardens?</p>

        <h2 class="session-title"><a href="#proposal-318696">Ethics of Interactive Journalism <span class="permalink">&para;</span></a></h2>
        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/tangentialism">David Yee</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">New tools for storytelling surface new questions of ethics that we as journalists and product practitioners must confront head-on. Immersive and interactive environments—as represented by VR and chat, respectively—change the context of reporting in critical human and cultural ways. What are the psychological implications of immersive journalism? How do cultural mores about conversation inform our work with bots? We will explore:

- the history of simulation in reporting
- the boundaries between effective virtual storytelling and inadvertent manipulation
- cultural lessons in machine-mediated conversation, and
- our responsibility to readers as they become interlocutors.

In exploring the edges of these new contexts for reporting, we hope to identify dangerous stretches of the road ahead and focus our initial efforts in new spaces in thoughtful and responsible 
ways.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/tangentialism">David Yee</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">As processor cycles plummet in price and open-source tools for machine learning become more accessible and sophisticated, it becomes reasonable to consider the role of machine learning in newsrooms and content management systems. We are intimately familiar with the ways in which recommendation engines can help us recirculate and identify similar content to our readers; but once we set that aside, what are the ways in which pattern detection can help journalists actually do their work? Using existing models for topic detection, natural language processing, and both supervised and unsupervised learning, we will investigate the boundaries of what reporters and machines do exceedingly well—all the while keeping a close eye on the singularity. How can machine learning best serve as an exoskeleton for the journalists as they gather and report the news? What are the tools we can build to surface signal where we need it the most?</p>

        <p class="session-description">At Marketplace we try to make every piece of audio, chart and interactive media embeddable. STEAL OUR STUFF! A soon to be published project creating charts for the 20th anniversary of welfare reform is our first big push to let others know that they can and should steal our stuff.

Let’s take a look at the opportunities, the constraints and examples of what has worked and what has not.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/thejqs">Jacob Quinn Sanders</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">It sticks with you. An exercise, an anecdote, a teacher, a colleague. They had a way of explaining, of teaching, something fundamental that years later you can't get out of your head. That in turn you use to teach, to illustrate, to explain the basics. One of my favorites -- one I think of to this day -- involved the making of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as a way of forcing attention to detail. Let's make these a more pervasive part of journalism's oral history. Let's share those exercises and tell those stories. Let's pass them on. Hell. We might act them out. (There might even be sandwiches.)</p>

        <p class="session-description">It's crunch time and you're in over your head on a project. You need to find a way to get it done and make it something you can be proud of. We'll talk about what to do when you feel a project might be slipping away — how to tell when you need help, how to get it and other strategies to make sure you can meet your deadlines without giving up on important pieces of the project.
Your mental health matters, too — we'll discuss ways to stay sane when things get stressful.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Readers are increasingly interacting with news content from a variety of locations, environments and levels of ability. As a result, news organizations need to think about creating platforms and stories that readers can access in as many ways as possible. This session will discuss best practices for web accessibility, graphics, closed captioning, and social media and facilitate a discussion about what news organizations are doing and how we can improve as an industry.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/caseymmiller">Casey Miller</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">No matter where you work, how old you are, or what your specific job title is, certain tasks can be rather daunting. The thought of asserting an opinion may seem horrifying. Asking for help - terrifying. And pitching an idea… well, that can be rather intimidating to say the least. I have experienced all of these feelings at some point. But I’ve also learned that it doesn’t have have to feel that way. Team dynamics, when positive, can play a huge part in making members feel included and heard. This plays an especially large roll when teams are split between multiple locations and/or include remote team members. Shared experiences and knowledge of each other’s lives can go a long way in helping teammates to become comfortable among one another. I have a couple of ideas about how to facilitate these kinds of relationships based on experiences within my own team, but I’m sure there are many, many more out there. I’d love to tell you about what has worked for my team and also for us to discuss other activities that have worked toward (or against) facilitating this kind of team dynamic.</p>

        <p class="session-description">You know something worth sharing, whether you know it or not. This session will be focused on demystifying how to share your knowledge with others — and on helping you figure out what the heck you know in the first place. If you've ever felt like you wanted to pitch an idea for a talk at a conference (like this one!), but you weren't sure what to pitch, this is the session for you.</p>

        <h2 class="session-title"><a href="#proposal-318672">Can we start a data release calendar for journalism? <span class="permalink">&para;</span></a></h2>
        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/christinezhang">Christine Zhang</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/YAN0">David Yanofsky</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Plenty of datasets are put out on a set schedule. How do we keep track of these? There are economic calendars for things like inflation and the employment rate on Bloomberg and Factset machines, but these are designed with financial professionals in mind, not journalists. Let’s make a collaborative data release calendar for the newsroom. What would it look like in contrast to existing tools? Can we do better than a planner file? What information would we want to include? How could it help us stay on top of newsworthy data releases, as well as discover new stories to tell?</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="session-proposal" id="proposal-318666">
        <h2 class="session-title"><a href="#proposal-318666">Can We Pair Program The News? <span class="permalink">&para;</span></a></h2>
        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/kateschimel">Katharine Schimel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanwb">Jordan Wirfs-Brock</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Usually, collaboration, especially in a small newsroom, looks a bit like this: Person A slogs in the trenches solo, cleans data, analyzes, comes up with an insight, writes a draft, sends to Person B. Person B realizes Person A likely made an error in the cleaning, tears apart draft, comes up with new insight. Person A goes back to square one, finds their error, redoes everything and sends it back. Person B questions their own judgement and sends the draft to Person C. Person C finds more errors Person B noticed but decided not to raise considering the hell they’d already put Person A through. Newsroom dissolves in a panic as Persons A, B and C all realize that this is going in next month’s issue so they’d better find, fix and spruce up these errors and fast.
In a slightly better world, Person A notices their error, asks Person B for help, Person B drops everything they’re doing, helps find the error in 100 lines of code and correct it, tries to explain what they did, and then, if they’re lucky, return to the work they were doing before. But again, newsroom panic is likely.
We think pair programming might be a way to short-circuit this cycle of agony and provide ways for small clusters of reporters to work together more effectively. For example, if Person A and Person B worked in tandem instead on projects like data cleaning, but also like writing, audio editing and page-designing, and helped catch errors early. That saves time and energy. We also think it could be a way to help build reusable skills in micro-newsrooms where multipurpose projects are a necessity. So instead of Person B simply correcting the error, they can correct the error in tandem with Person A so Person A can now fix that problem for themselves.
We don’t know for sure this will work but we want to try to out different models of collaboration. In essence, we’d like to run an experiment on a group of SRCCON attendees: Can pair programming and other forms of collaboration drawn from outside the journalism field help resolve some of our own intractable problems?
Here’s what we imagine the session looking like:
Intro discussion on what pair programming is, why people do it, what makes pairing different from other forms of collaboration (10 min)
Pairing activity - Attendees will split into pairs, pick a non-programming task (analyzing a data set, writing a script, editing audio, etc.) and use pair programming techniques to complete that task (25 min)
Groups share their experiences (5 min)
Discussion - What other types of process from programming can we adopt in the newsroom? (10 min)</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/@miajain">Soumya Jain</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">As news producers and disseminators, we have a lot of information to share through multiple distribution platforms. As a consumer, we have so  many sources to absorb this information from. Still there is a huge disconnect on both sides resulting in a broken experience. With a billion track points provided from all ends - how can we leverage data to be alluring for actionable insights and a better experience?</p>

    <div class="session-proposal" id="proposal-318661">
        <h2 class="session-title"><a href="#proposal-318661">Coders off the coasts <span class="permalink">&para;</span></a></h2>
        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/kateschimel">Katharine Schimel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanwb">Jordan Wirfs-Brock</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">The wave of digital media startups and projects, and the rapid growth of the coder-journalist community, has brought new career opportunities to a floundering industry and attracted people with a wider range of skillsets and interests than ever before. However, many of those opportunities are clustered on the coasts and in major cities like New York, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. (See this article by Josh Beton for a great exploration of the problem: http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/03/the-game-of-concentration-the-internet-is-pushing-the-american-news-business-to-new-york-and-the-coasts/.) But there are a couple of major problems with this: (1) Journalists who don’t want to move to the coasts are forced to choose between living somewhere they love and advancing their career; (2) It sucks talent away from communities across the country who could benefit from coder journalists. So much vital data exists at the local level (examples: fossil fuel production, education performance, heroin use, political spending). The ability to analyze it locally is crucial to communities, who need information about their particular area -- not just national-level information.
In this session, we’ll start with a group-wide discussion identifying some of the challenges involved in coding off the coasts (attracting talent, mentorship and skill building, avoiding brain drain, assuring that there are desirable career paths for people who want to be coder journalists but don’t want to move to New York). Then, we might break out into smaller groups who can discuss each of those problems and brainstorm some potential (actionable) solutions.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/Chronotope">Aram Zucker-Scharff</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Adblockers, malware, load times. How can we break the cycle of bad business and worse code sinking journalism? Advertising technology is unavoidably part of our sites and stories. Right now it slows our output; damages our relationship with readers; and is failing even to fund most of our efforts. Without collaboration to create better tools and processes we are failing. Newsrooms, sales floors and tech teams must come together to repair our relationship with users and advertisers or find ourselves without the resources to continue.

The session would focus on starting the multi-team conversations we aren't having. How can we work together to earn and keep the trust and attention of our readers? How can our organizations collaborate to build better, more open, and more trustworthy alternatives to malware-infested inaccurate ad tech? What would that look like and what data could we comfortably provide advertisers so we can better manage expectations? What are the conversations we should be having, the tools we should be building, with our sales departments?</p>

        <p class="session-description">Some of us in our business no longer fit into either feral-cat trap: no longer purely journalists of traditional skill, not brilliant technologists. We were the local government reporters. The cops reporters. The assistant city editors. And then we learned to code. Probably badly. Probably recently. We know more than enough to be dangerous and we keep learning all the time -- but where to put us? How to include us? How to value us? How to manage us and our ambitions? How to encourage us -- and when to rein us in? This would be a frank discussion for the benefit of those who still feel caught between two skill sets in an environment that often still sees those sets as separate, those who manage them, those who teach them, and those who work alongside them.</p>

        <p class="session-description">As technology and our capacity grows, data projects become more and more ambitious. We scrape millions of rows and present readers a whole universe of information with one news app or interactive page. But is it always the more the merrier? When we throw this much unprocessed information at readers, do they all have the ability to sift through it and find the "nut graph" of the story? Or is nut graph even a necessary part of news these days with all the big data available to explore? The line between news and academic research has blurred more and more since we started catching up with their toolbox. How to distinguish ourselves from a think tank or an academic institution and not to bore our readers with too much information and numbers is the question everyone in the news industry should ask themselves. "Less is more" should not only be applied to writing, but for data reporting as well. In this session, let's discuss successful and not so successful examples of "too much data", think about when is it time to give up the desire of "show them all", how to trim down information effectively to create a truly enjoyable experience for readers, and hopefully come up with a draft of guidelines for future practices.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Pageviews suck. They tell you nothing about how your audience engages with your content. They should not be your baseline measurement for success.

But before you move on from the pageview, you have to define success. This session will help you define success for you, your team and your organization. From there, we can think about better metrics that will allow you to measure your success. Rather than dream of new tools, we will talk about how existing tools like Google Analytics can help you with measurement. We will also discuss techniques for effectively communicating learnings from analytical measurement to the rest of your newsroom and beyond.</p>

        <p class="session-description">A 24-hour news culture has been holding breaking news dear since its inception. Based on the long-standing tradition of competitive journalism, being the first one to break a story is both intended and appreciated among journalists. However, what happens after breaking news is published isn’t widely discussed. This talk will fill in this gap by answering the following questions: 1) Is it beneficial to break a story as an absolutely first one? 2) Where do people get breaking news during major events? 3) How do search and social serve different roles in bringing traffic to various breaking stories?</p>

        <p class="session-description">Audience development has become a hot, new buzzword inside nearly every news organization across the country. Everyone, it seems, is clamoring to hire an audience team.  But what exactly is audience development? How do you find these magical creatures? What do they do? And can they really help connect your journalism with more people?

The simple answer is yes. If you do it right.

FRONTLINE has had an audience development team for four years, and it has been transformative. We’ve learned that when our editorial and audience teams work side by side, hand in hand we CAN make magic together. We've seen double and triple digit growth across multiple platforms. But the process isn’t always easy, pretty or comfortable.

In this session we’ll have an open and honest conversation about our lessons learned. We’ll share stories of success and failures. And we’ll offer practical advice and tips for people who work in traditional newsrooms -- and for traditional bosses uncomfortable with thinking about audience.  We’d also open it up to the room to hear more about how other newsrooms are approaching this.</p>

        <p class="session-description">“If [people] were able to be convinced that art is precise advance knowledge of how to cope with the psychic and social consequences of the next technology, would they all become artists?” Marshall McLuhan wrote in Understanding Media. Should we all become artists? I seriously thought about it last year. Here’s why: Whether we use text, images, graphics or code to tell stories, we deal with symbols, images, abstractions and interpretations every day. Journalism’s history is basically one of integrating new disciplines, techniques and technologies to more effectively tell stories. Lately, and especially for the data/tech community in news, that’s involved stats, social science, computer science and other quantitative- or science-oriented fields. Although we should continue to do this vigorously, we equally need to embrace the arts. And not just from a visual or design standpoint, but the ideas that underlie and advance art. In doing this, we can also see how seemingly disparate things correspond: cubism and physics, concrete poetry and GUIs, conceptual art and algorithms. We’ll explore these and other ways the analog humanities can help us think about digital media from technical and humanistic perspectives -- going everywhere from abstraction and to Afrofuturism.</p>

In this session, I will share lessons learned from building a program that is at the intersection of growing and engaging a community of residents while also helping developers build better tools.

        <p class="session-description">Mobile devices gather information about us as we go about our days by default, and we often voluntarily grant access to additional information in exchange for access to apps and services. News organizations could be taking better advantage of what mobile devices track, delivering better news experiences by taking into account time of day and a user’s location and personal preferences. But how much information are users willing to give up about themselves? And where should we draw the line between offering valuable experiences and being overly invasive? 

This workshop will prompt thinking about questions around privacy and mobile use, casting participants in the role of users (which we all are, anyway) and asking them to consider: What personal information would you be willing to give up for the sake of a news-focused digital service, and why? We’ll discuss the range of permissions that mobile developers have access to, and debate when and how they might be used to deliver better experiences. At the end the session we’ll have considered as a group the ways users may want to limit the personal data they share, and also what kinds of convenience or customization in news experiences on mobile would make the exchange of personal information more palatable.</p>

        <p class="session-description">The boons of publishing large, searchable databases are easy to grasp — with the right dataset, they can be major sources of traffic. It's easy to talk about the technical challenges of creating and maintaining these apps, and it's easy to argue for their existence in favor of openness — but what about the ethical challenges? There is much we've collectively learned over the course of nearly six years of maintaining the Texas Tribune's salary and prisoner databases. No matter how prepared you may be for the inevitable requests for exclusion, eventually there will be a request that causes you to pause and ask, "wait, are we doing this right?" What do you do when your established protocol is woefully inadequate for a person's request? When your news app puts you or your organization in the position of power, how do you ensure the humans in the data are treated with empathy? Our goal with this session is to encourage a dialog on and around these issues. We will go over our current policies, and share stories of what we've done well... and what we've done not so well.

        <p class="session-description">Teams within an organization are usually pretty structured. One group might share a common focus, office space and manager. But communities are a much more fluid – they move beyond the designated org chart lines and boundaries drawn by the company. 

Some of the best collaboration in news and tech comes when different specialities mix. Whether you’re a lonely coder or on a large news app team, how do you build and sustain a community of data- and tech-oriented journalists within your organization? 

What kind of obstacles does this internal community face?
- How do you help everyone level-up, including yourself? 
- How do you make sure knowledge and skills aren’t concentrated among a small group -- or just one person? 
- How do you get management buy-in for cross-pollination type training 
push back against training bc of timing on both sides; tension between a dedicated team and individuals doing similar work/working on a different part of the project
- How do you maintain momentum if there's no institutional structure or the structure changes? 

Can we come up with some solutions to these problems?

We want to hear your experience and advice for internal community-building, even if it’s not directly related to data and tech. We’ll discuss all these topics, then break into small groups. Each group will have one item to expand on and contribute back to the session transcript. In the end, we’ll have an internal community-building guide to share.</p>

One half will be tasked to brainstorm ways existing or future technology can help spur diversity in journalism and the tech world – two industries that so far suck at diversity and inclusion.

And the other half will explore the flip side: how can diversity help technology?

Depending on how many people we have, smaller groups may be splintered off for better brainstorming (and fewer cooks in the kitchen) and more ideas!

Model example:

Group 1: how can technology help diversity?
- Subgroup a = IDEA 1
- Subgroup b = IDEA 2
- Subgroup c = IDEA 3
Group 2: how can diversity help technology?
- Subgroup a = IDEA 1

Though the years, software developers have managed to communicate with sales teams, designers, and C-levels. However, a new ingredient has recently been added to the mix: data science teams. Even harmless planning sessions might turn problematic when the output from data scientists, whose background is mainly academic, is crucial to the product. Is there an optimal way of communicating between teams that have such diverse background without spending long hours in fruitless meetings? How do you explain to your data scientists that having to wait for more than 20 seconds for a prediction is not "production ready", regardless of the model's achieved accuracy? Data Science has made it possible for companies everywhere to extract insights from tons of data sources, regardless of their volume or diversity. But, is there a way to help your front-end developers understand the importance of scalability when working with large sets of data?

        <p class="session-description">APIs are a technology that are -- finally? maybe? -- getting their day in the sun. Do you want to risk your newsroom getting left behind? At the same time, solid APIs are not easy to build, and they can require serious maintenance. They should not be taken lightly.

This session will explain what an API (Application Programming Interface) is, and how it can it can improve your newsroom. (Though we might  also try to talk you out of creating an API!)

We'll talk about API  best practices, API integrations, and how to explain APIs (and their value) to your bosses.  As a concrete example, the session will walk through the brand-new WBUR API. We'll talk about its features, as well as its flaws; how it's powering a new website and and a mobile app (and, with any luck, the screen on your refrigerator); and the process we went through to create it (as well as what we would do differently).</p>

        <p class="session-description">Photojournalism has fallen hard in the past decade and technology may deserve part of the blame. News is now read on six-inch screens not two-foot pages, anyone with a smartphone is a decent photographer, and video ads pay far more than their static counterparts. As journalism goes digital, photo gets left behind. Consequently, as newsrooms make cuts, sometimes to afford digital teams, photojournalists and photo departments are the first to go. How can we empower photojournalists and photo-based storytelling through digital presentation and interaction instead of diminishing photojournalism through endless embedded images and sliders? Let’s figure it out.</p>

At the same time, purely linear data storytelling forms (static infographics) remain incredibly popular. Participants in this session will draft broad guidelines for when it’s desirable to use fully interactive, non-interactive and hybrid approaches to presenting data. We will start by narrowing a manageable list of forms to tackle. Examples might include “fully interactive maps,” vs. “directed interactive maps” (where users can toggle two layers) vs. animated maps illustrating change over time. Next we will assign a small group to tackle each form, asking members to identify circumstances to which this format is best suited. The written document we produce at the end will help us articulate, for a diverse newsroom audience, the most effective options for digital storytelling.</p>

And unlike the Arduino, you can work in Bash, Python and even Node, making the learning curve short and shallow. At CIR we use a motion-detecting Raspberry Pi to let us know when certain meeting rooms are occupied. 

This session is an opportunity to geek out over the big world of hardware hacking and develop ideas for gathering our own data.  I would introduce the basic mechanics of a Raspberry Pi and a set of sensors like motion detectors, temperature/humidity readers and cameras. We would brainstorm and develop ideas for stories that use data gathered by one or more Raspberry Pis.

Alternatively, the group might settle on a single big idea using distributed sensors, with the idea that we might build them when in our home newsrooms and share the data with one another.</p>

Maybe it's best to admit defeat and scale back our features, producing more static, less interactive content. Or should we fight against our limits and find ways to make our features work everywhere? Most importantly, how do we communicate our decision-making process to others and establish reasonable expectations in the newsroom?

At WIRED, ads help us pay the bills, but even some of us are guilty of using every ad-blocking extension existing on the web. Earlier this year, we decided to block our stories for readers using ad blockers, while simultaneously offering folks an option to subscribe to an "ad-free" version of the site.  

So why take on ad blockers? Well, in terms of numbers, it just made sense. A really large number of Wired readers block(ed) ads on desktop. But ad-free wasn’t just about numbers. It was an experiment and we’ve learned a lot from it. That’s what this session will be all about. It will be a glorious debate but also a discussion about the lessons learned from implementing an ad-free experience. What are the best ways to block ad blockers? Is ad-blocking extortion? Are ads ethical? What’s a good/bad ad? Is it our responsibility to protect our reader's’ privacy? Do we even need ads? How can journalism affect the way ads work? Should our content be ‘free’? What are the misconceptions about ad-blocking? What’s next?

We will talk code, ethics, privacy and tracking, monetizing journalistic content, and how ads can ruin/better journalism.</p>

For our latest investigation, the Panama Papers, we gathered more than 370 journalists from almost 80 countries to mine 11.5 million files.

One of the missions of ICIJ's Data &amp; Research Unit is to create the tools to make these collaborations happen seamlessly across borders. We've implemented social network platforms for reporters to communicate the findings, developed platforms to search over millions of documents and data and also to explore them visually. With reporters collaborating more and more across borders - or with different organizations - our challenge today could be yours tomorrow. Learn from our successes (and mistakes).

        <p class="session-description">Pseudocoding is a method of writing code logic in plain English. I butcher the definition and propose we use the idea of pseudocode as a framework for writing an outline for code and defining a project's features. I'll briefly introduce the concept of pseudocoding, why I use it and a few examples of how to write it (plus a couple comments of support from coworkers who have tried it). Then we'll break up into groups, write pseudocode--with pen and paper!--for a couple projects and share our experiences and results. We'll also discuss other methods people use now to outline or organize projects before they dive in.

For new coders, it's also a great introduction to some core concepts of programming and how to think like a coder.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Ok, so we’ve pasted in the Google Analytics tag, we have numbers and graphs coming in, so now what? Installing an analytics tool is traditionally trivial, but trying to understand what these tools are tell us can be tricky, complicated, and daunting. How can we make the data more meaningful for journalists, product managers, and developers? Are we tracking the right data? Do we know our users better after looking at the numbers? Let’s come together and discuss different ways to help get better insights into how our users consume our content. We’ll discuss how to help teams make informed daily decisions, how to perform deeper analysis of trends and behaviors, and how to determine if our strategies are working as expected. If you’ve found techniques that are helpful, we want you to share them. If you have questions on how to get better data for particular use-cases, we want you to ask them. By the end of the session we want everyone to walk away with specific and actionable ideas on how to better understand their audience through data. We will try and group tables together of people using the same analytics tools (Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Parsely, Charbeat, etc).</p>

        <p class="session-description">As journalists have to compete for attention with countless other content producers, interactive storytellers have increasingly been using personalization as to entice their audiences. There's growing trend in journalism to place the reader into the story and give them a personalized understanding of the story. 

But how can we leverage personalization in news and not freak out our audiences about exposing them to unnecessary security risks? We will start by looking at 2-3 examples of where personalization went awfully wrong.  Afterwards,  participants will split up into groups and come up with a code of ethics (3-5 principles every journalist should consider when doing this kind of journalism) and solutions for making sure user information (anything from input info to geolocation) is not vulnerable to hackers or stored in databases.</p>

        <p class="session-description">The year is 2016. Distribution channels are multiplying, splaying content across a plethora of platforms and formats. AMP, FB Instant, and Apple News are just the start - mobile/responsive web, native apps, Instagram and Snapchat herald a world where your site isn't your site. Content needs to adapt and mutate in order to thrive. The Markdown/HTML-in, HTML-out model of CMSs of yore is falling by the wayside. Content producers in offices across the world are copy-and-pasting and cropping until their fingers bleed, just to keep up.

Before you argue that writers and editors should just write semantically rich HTML and CSS, thus effortlessly enabling seamless distribution across all these channels ... oh, wait, this is SRCCON and no-one would argue that. The web is great, but not perfect. HTML and CSS are incredible tools for developers and designers, but fall short at addressing the needs of writers and editors who want to publish beautiful stories, not learn the ins-and-outs of producing semantically rich (and correct) markup. For years, Markdown or WYSIWYG editors plus primitive "raw HTML" views have worked in tandem to address some of these shortcomings, but can't keep up in the long term while remaining usable for our writers and editors.

We've been working on some of these issues, and would love to explore the problems and potential solutions with the SRCCON community, since we're sure others are encountering the challenges of publishing beautiful, rich content simultaneously to many formats and contexts, too.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Most audio and video content on the web sits neatly in a box unable to be shared, searched or easily navigated. In the era of 'silent video' and Cassetteboy-style remixes, how can we make it easier for viewers and listeners to distribute audiovisual content? And how do we make it accessible to and addressable by everyone?

Quietly taking over the social web, silent video is easily and unobtrusively slotted into social media streams, viewers can consume without listening and with a click add the aural dimension. Good examples of silent video are captioned.

Technology exists to liberate media by coupling it with textual representations. Simply by adding a transcript to audiovisual content we can make it searchable and more accessible, link the words to media time-points and we make it more navigable and shareable. 

This technology is applicable to top-down and bottom-up journalism alike - from the news organisation to the Podcaster and Vlogger.

In this session we aim to explore the opportunities that timed transcripts present, discuss existing applications, unearth new ones and detail resources that can help us realise our ideas.</p>

Often, they end up as the things developers curse when they want to build out a unique piece of journalism or put effort into data projects. Solutions typically range from static generators to comprehensive off-CMS tools, but are developers missing an opportunity to make interactive and data journalism a deep-seeded part of the news process? Is there still value in integration, or is a wide splay of tools our best option? Should everyone be working on the CMS instead of a dedicated team? Can modern, API-driven CMSes survive in a fast-paced news dev world?</p>

In this session, we'll take a narrative-driven design approach to imagine systems which could be built now to realize some of the promises of structured journalism. Starting with audience, reporter, and publisher personas, we'll develop user stories which give shape to tools and systems which fit into real lives and solve real problems.

        <p class="session-description">Data is not an inherently user-friendly medium.  

Until recently, the experience a nontechnical person might have of encountering  data would likely be accompanied by a thick stack of annotated research documents and/or the literal data scientist who wrote the report explaining the results in person. 

Today, data is a living, breathing part of storytelling the material of our daily lives. When a simple snapshot on Twitter has the instant potential to transform the way that someone views themselves inside of a system, data is a visceral and emotional companion to the news cycle.  That's because when you see a great visualization that connects truth with insight, you can't un-see it.  When the power to wield data is in the hands of the public, and people tell their own stories to each other,  data becomes a medium for civic art. 

The question is, what happens to data when it crosses the chasm from analysis to impact?  How can small building blocks of information resonate with a broader narrative?  How can you design for this effect when you don't know what the data is going to say?

This workshop will arm participants with the practical (and emotional) tools every team needs to perform repeatable alchemy for powerful data storytelling.</p>

How can help news developers grow their sphere of influence within a newsroom? Let's talk about what the barriers to expanding our community — what are they and how can we solve them? At Northwestern, students and faculty at Knight Lab have been working to infect the school with the programming bug — we've taken an iterative approach to trying to grow the diverse community of journalism students on campus who are able to make cool things on the Internet. We've been working on answering these questions through community events, outreach and a lot of trial and error. I think there are lessons to be learned for the developer-journalism community at large — I'd love to share what we've learned and discuss other efforts that we can all draw from.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Algorithms play an increasingly relevant role in shaping our digital and physical experiences of the world. It is frequently the case that data from our digital footprints is used to predict our behavior and make decisions about the choices available to us. This unprecedented capacity to collect and analyze data has brought along with it a troubling dismissiveness of user agency, participation, and ownership. Such systems assume that it is an acceptable by-product for their users to have no understanding of the decisions being made about them and no agency in that decision-making process. For the most part, the invisibilized nature of these decisions are seen as a feature, not a bug, of a good user experience. As we begin to use algorithmic decision-making in areas of our lives that are increasingly high-stakes, it is essential that we create and utilize processes that maintain user agency and understanding. In this session, participants will be imagining and designing user experiences that employ participatory algorithmic-decision making processes. The session will be open to folks from all experience levels. We would be excited to see folks from a variety of different backgrounds, including designers, data scientists, journalists, privacy &amp; security practitioners, and organizers from marginalized and frequently surveilled communities.</p>

Imagine our time is the Age of Attention (Eyeballs, brand loyalty, Internet, cell phones, always being connected). Loyalty of customers is everything. Products with the best engineers build free services to repackage attention and sell it back to advertisers. 
Then what is to come? From the media landscape, there is more information than ever, so the ability to have the right perspective on interpreting the information becomes important (i.e. Culture, understanding the "big data", authenticity).

From Harriet Beecher Stowe to Upton Sinclair, from Lois Lane to Stieg Larsson’s Mikael Blomkvist, from private moments that shift cultural thinking (Joan Didion writing about loss) or shift politics (Mary McCarthy’s biting criticism), or even new graphic novels that alter our usual approach to reporting and history.  These works shape the times in which we live.  And they can teach unexpected lessons about the craft.

        <p class="session-description">The formula seems simple: something happens and we report on it. The faster the better, so long as we follow standards. But the pace accelerated, and what was fast for print was slow compared to radio; what was fast for radio accelerated for television; what was fine for a 30 second segment on a news show couldn’t fill time on 24/7 cable news, and now everything else seems slow and antiquated compared to the internet.  Now a tweet from a source is seconds away from being worldwide Breaking News at any second.

Editors need tools that enable quick publishing on their own platforms and social/distribution channels. They also need evolving guidelines on how to use them. Newsroom technologists need to build stable and iterable tools so editors can keep tabs on their product, their audience and the competition. Meanwhile, readers expect the news to find them with minimal effort. Features that seem great one moment are clichéd the next. 

How do we balance all those moving parts? How do we reach people who define relevant breaking news for themselves?  How do we answer multiple audiences when they do seek out breaking news — news-junkies, news-curious and late-comers?

This conversation will look inside two newsrooms: the New York Times (storied, weighty, with history and reputation) and Breaking News (younger, nimble and not only of the internet, but of Twitter). What lessons intersect in the Venn diagram of these two organizations?

Tiff Fehr, Assistant Editor for Interactive News (Live Coverage) at the NYT, and Martin McClellan, Senior UX Designer at Breaking News will lead the discussion.</p>

Sometimes we feel lost in the ocean of knowledge needs to be learned, hats need to be worn and the confusion which specialization we should take as a career path. In this session, let’s talk about ways to organize our teams and the possible best practice - how to design team members' roles, attribute responsibilities and optimize workflows. We also want to discuss career development for news nerds - what would be expected in us in the future and how should we get prepared? Is “jack-of-all-trades” still the rule of thumb here? Or should we start picking up skills more selectively at some point and tell ourselves “it’s ok not knowing something”?</p>

        <p class="session-description">or, "Dig Through Time"

Pitchfork started 20 years ago. Just a wee baby. The New Yorker hit 91 years in age. The NYTimes, Guardian,  Washington Post, Galena Gazette, and more have several centuries worth of content between them. However it's fair to say that 90% of daily traffic goes directly against stories published in the last week.

Archive stories can hold a rich and unique mirror to the events of today, but face a number of challenges in being found and resurfaced: organization, classification, relevancy. Resurfacing content from even moderately sized archives is a challenge: often, it’s as much art as science. It is almost a brute force exercise to determine quality and notability. Yet we know there is a meaningful history and legacy buried there. How do we make sense of the present when we cannot easily access the past?

Why is this hard? We often think in historical terms over decades - and rarely in the smaller events that define our day to day. Staff across many departments may not have the necessary depth of knowledge about the archives to know where to draw from, and institutional knowledge is lost between generations. Metadata and taxonomy may not be established to help classify and surface. Tooling may not exist or may be inaccessible to guide making intelligent suggestions.

In this talk, we’ll explore working with your archives by talking about how we work with ours. Low-hanging fruit to bring gems to the surface, long-term strategies to make archives more accessible, and to ensure that today's content is accessible tomorrow.</p>

        <p class="session-description">The internet is rife with tools to clip, remix, and gif visual content: we make reaction gifs of our favorite TV shows, screenshot articles to highlight interesting ideas, and have gif buttons built into many of our social networks. For fans of audio content, like podcasts, however, there are far fewer tools that allow them to engage with, comment on, and share their fandom of their favorite show. This creates a twofold problem: fans can't highlight, comment on, or share parts of their favorite podcast, and potential new listeners can't discover shows through those clips and highlights. In this session, we'll explore the idea of what "giffable audio" might be. We'll discuss what forms of expression we can support through giffable audio, what unique and interesting affordances audio (and more specifically, podcasts) might have, and how we can design tools that can create this new kind of audio culture on social media. We'll also discuss what tools and technologies currently exist in this realm, including our own project, Clipper, which is an in-progress web audio tool that allows podcast fans to clip audio into short, shareable snippets that can instantly be embedded on social media.</p>

Does developing for news mean adopting an inherently waterfall processes or are there ways to be more agile? Can we avoid the UX and dev teams acting like an internal agency to editorial clients? Is "process" a dirty word, or do frameworks for project management really help?

I've got lots of questions about this. We grapple with it all the time. Maybe we should get together and compare notes?</p>

        <p class="session-description">The README serves as welcome-mat to most open source projects, and it's often a critical gateway to engagement in the open source and open journalism space. Good READMEs couple well with other all-caps files like LICENSES, CONTRIBUTOR.md, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md files, but sometimes the standards for what to include, how to design, and where to feature your README aren't explicit to new developers or new-to-open-source programmers. Further, projects who bring some special character to their README benefit from attracting more users, earning more publicity and cross-postings, and can be lauded as "cool" even though the actually base project or tech functionality is buggy. That said, even if your tech is 110% awesome, you can lose people if your README, compile instructions, or general repository details are awkward or obscure. This is a session about github netiquette, README design, and repository architecture that engages your chosen community in collaboration and contribution; we'll showcase some cool hacks for advanced README authorship as well as how to create a README that suit your project and prospective contributors alike.</p>

Another thing I love is that when they complete their degrees a year later, we're number one on their list of prospective employers. 

And another thing is that, eight years into the program, seven out of the eleven interns who've graduated are now full time developers at the BBC. Four of them are seniors.

So, maybe you'd like to share your experiences of running internships and we can compare notes.</p>

In a few short years that landscape is unrecognizable, and the search and social-network referral engines have morphed into distribution behemoths. "Back in the day" our biggest challenge was getting the print side to listen to digital, then moving their attention from Desktop to Mobile. We've barely achieved that and the goalposts have moved even further. Forget recirc, ad-blocking, responsive web, web page performance, native apps - all reduced to minor players in the last year. Now we're in the territory of bots (maybe) and distribution on proprietary platforms.

Given finite resources to build a newsroom from scratch what do you focus on from day one? How do you structure scalability, design, distribution, and viability with the journalistic mission to inform the public? Now how does that model compare to your current organization?</p>

As a 20-year-old intern, I taught a reporter in a smaller local newsroom how to use Excel. There are countless uses for developers and tech-minded journalists in newsrooms, but the reporters there might not be equipped with the toolkit necessary to pursue those stories and provider better public service journalism. 
In this session, I would like to take SRCCON's network of incredible, intelligent journalists and expand that to include reporters at small, local papers, whose continually watch their staffs shrink and budgets get cut. I believe we can form mentor-mentee relationships and come up with ways to teach small-paper journalists to think about data and code, even if it's done remotely (because the internet!). Throughout this session, I hope to brainstorm different ways to forge connections with other journalists; for instance, if you're based in New York City, this would be a great time to get in touch with fellow journalists in Buffalo and Schenectady. These connections would also give big city reporters a better eye into what's happening, and of course, story ideas, in smaller localities.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Developers, software engineers, designers, etc, can all attest to solving problems on the job. Yet, it's one thing to be logical in the professional realm, and another to keep the same practicality in life. 
This discussion wants to dive a little bit in problem solvers' minds when they're faced with life problems. Do they apply the same reasoning and critical thinking?  If not, why is that?  Understanding that life problems have different implications than work ones, it would be interesting to look at the differences and assess if they truly make life problems harder to approach. At work, it's not very recommended to ignore a task because it's hard, or painful. So why do it when it comes life problems that may affect our happiness?
On the other hand, if problem solvers keep the same pragmatic mentality in real life, has that proven to be successful? If so how do they keep a level head, and how to others receive it?
Without needing to go into private details, this session could be a short and interesting discussion on whether or not the work brain can be successfully applied to life.</p>

Publishing the data inevitably raises the question of how we respond to the issues raised:
We will share our methodology and ask how we can encourage other UGC hosts to open their abuse data?
Plus tackle some of the challenges in how to respond, namely, is it possible to de-toxify the discussion around topics we found attract higher amounts of abuse like Israel/Palestine and Feminism, or for particular contributors? How to manage the moderation load whilst maintaining a civil conversation?

However, we now face a growing array of other ways to distribute our content to readers using mobile devices: native iOS and Android apps, AMP, Facebook Instant, Apple News, and more. This session will dive into the array of questions we face in confronting the restrictions these environments place on interactives and storytelling. It will give us a chance swap strategies for building code that works great (or at least works) on these platforms, and a space to talk about navigating the business and editorial pressure to use them over traditional responsive mobile experiences.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Software maintenance has been estimated to account for between 60 and 70% of costs in the average software development project. In a newsroom setting, writing and building on deadline and with an eye toward long-term maintenance is a tricky balance. Neglecting it can lead to linkrot, deprecated apps, and a lazy reliance on SEO to define the public record; overemphasizing it may induce existential paralysis. How are different newsrooms building, producing, and maintaining their apps and/or large, complex stories? Who's responsible for this kind of archiving and preservation work? And how do the methods of archiving shape the future of the story itself? This session will discuss a few case studies of both neglected and well-maintained projects (primarily in the context of reporting on large file dumps and data leaks) to explore potential guiding principles for maintenance-driven journalism. Participants are encouraged to come prepared to share examples of broken or well-maintained news apps or instances of what they consider successes or failures in journalism maintenance.</p>

        <p class="session-description">You're throwing a fancy party for your friends, so you hire a chef. There are certain expectations between you and the chef: they will cook food; the food will be good; they will respect your home; they will reflect well upon you and treat your friends as their own guests; they will not put business cards on each plate; they will not poison your friends, introduce wolves, or burn your house down.

These guidelines apply equally well to those of us providing shareable components for embedding on other people's websites. We are co-hosts to other people's guests. We should provide the service we advertise on the tin, not break people's stuff, and generally remember we are part of someone else's story and need to make them look better to their readers. (And not inject malware.)

Through discussion and example, we'll explore the various concerns especially relevant to third-party shareable component providers, and curate a clear and concise set of best practices.</p>

It ensures more successful releases, happier customers, and less development redundancy. But what about stakeholders? How and when we include various department stakeholders can dictate make or break on-time releases, features additions (or subtractions), and an overall smooth or bumpy development process.

Let’s share examples of publishers making the most of this new creative format which demands a different story-telling style, combining text, animation and video.

Optimising for this silent format is also a great reason to make your videos accessible through subtitles or closed-captions. Whether you’re already captioning your videos or looking to get started let’s go through recently developed tools for making this easier including crowdsourcing (Amara) and Speech To Text (Trint) and how you can integrate them into your workflows publishing on YouTube and Facebook.</p>

        <p class="session-description">You got an offer to work at a really cool, and rapidly growing company. Your new title, “junior [insert specifics here]” has been added to your email signature, Facebook and Twitter accounts.
You start on the job, full of excitement about opportunities to grow, learn, and gain more leverage in the industry. Then you come to realize that the company has a lot going on, and the harder, grittier tasks that would foster your growth are only assigned to senior level employees. You are given problems that aren’t somewhat challenging, but not very impactful. You go through moments of panic, frustration, and loss. In the long run, how do you do to maintain your happiness and engagement?

This is a scenario that seems to be recurrent amongst junior employees at large companies, but this session is for anyone that has felt that their skills weren’t being fostered in the workplace. 
The discussion would be roughly divided like so:
- Are people making excuses, or are they genuinely being smothered by corporations for various reasons (culture, personality,  etc...)?  
- What are some ways to get out of these unfulfilling situations, or avoid them altogether, at the individual scale? 
- Do you have ideas of what corporations could do to facilitate (and monitor) the growth of their junior (or any) employees?</p>

        <p class="session-description">“A new form of journalism.” That’s what George Gallup said that asking people about their preferences equates to—and that was back in the 1930s (“Politics and the New Machine,” The New Yorker, November 16, 2015). The goal of listening to audiences isn’t a new one and is highly valuable for producing powerful news presentations. Yet many media organizations aren’t utilizing user research today because of lack of funds, recording equipment, physical space and/or expert guidance. In lacking easy ways to gain insights into people's busy lives, news teams can become overly dependent on their own instincts. This results in unimaginative story presentations and tired templates that fail to engage existing and would­-be audiences.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Let’s discuss and sketch what a user research toolkit for distributed news teams might look like. What combination of methods for listening and observation (including but not limited to interviews, surveys, usability testing and co-­design techniques) would help your own team’s efforts? How can we best enable people working across functions to run their own audience research? What would it take for newsrooms to adopt a more flexible take on the traditional usability lab? This session will involve a lot of creativity as well as real talk about organizational change and costs considerations. Come join as we democratize user experience research access to make improvements for reader, viewer and listener benefit.</p>

        <p class="session-description">We all know that it's important to have more diversity in tech, but there has been frustrating little progress on this front. It can be demoralizing when senior executives don't prioritize diversity as an issue and the task of changing the culture at a company can feel overwhelming. These challenges are especially acute at companies that have not historically considered themselves tech companies, because the senior leadership is often not as aware of the barriers and biases against women in technical roles.

As we continue to expand the technology group at The New York Times, we are actively invested in diversity and inclusion. We firmly believe that our workforce should reflect our audience, which is global and diverse. Diversity drives growth and innovation, and a diverse workforce allows us to best serve our readers by speaking authentically about more experiences.

We are organizing this session to brainstorm and discuss on-the-ground techniques to support the hiring, retention and advancement of diverse talent in technology, with a focus on how to effect change at large organization outside of Silicon Valley.

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/risatrix">Amanda Krauss</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Do you, or anyone you know, feel personally victimized by tech debt? If you work for any sort of digital organization, the answer is probably yes. If you’re on the tech side, you feel frustrated when you try to tell non-coders and business folks why it’s a priority. If you’re not on the tech side, you feel frustrated at hearing the phrase “tech debt” repeated over and over, without any apparent connection to your department’s priorities.

If we take a step back, we might find that debt isn't right metaphor for what we’re talking about. What we call "tech debt" is incurred not by individual debtors, but by organization-wide processes (or lack thereof). And unlike monetary debt, most tech debt can’t be paid off quickly, even if you have financial resources to throw at it. We need better ways to describe what tech debt is, how it builds up, and how to fix it, in terms that the whole company can understand.

In this session, I’ll talk about metaphors (such as home renovation) that have helped our newsroom unite in our success over considerable tech debt, and invite participants to share their own experiences of explaining or hearing about technical debt. By creating a campaign to explain tech debt effectively, participants will leave equipped to get organizational buy-in by making communication the first step of your technical debt plan.</p>

        <p class="session-description">As a data science consultant, I use methods from statistics, machine learning, and design to solve problems. Communicating our findings effectively is to key to our success; it’s important to both 1) faithfully and accurately present the data, the findings, and our recommendations, while 2) presenting all of that information in a quick, easily digestible way. Often, our end users don’t have the time or technical expertise to comprehensively study our entire method, but neither do they ever want to blindly trust a “black box” method. So where is the in-between? 

I'll start the discussion by going through some of our experiences in communicating data science ideas both honestly and intuitively: from data visualization design choices, to experiential learning as a means for clients to understand complex ideas, to presentations with our end-to-end approach illustrated in simple analogies. 

Then I'd like to open up the floor,  and learn from everybody else's experience. Time willing, I'd like to provide the opportunity for people to take a stab at presenting technical ideas of their own, and present them to the group in an intuitive way.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/anieldaniel">Annie Daniel</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Let’s talk about our internship programs from both sides of the fence.
Internships are weird. For interns, they’re faced with crippling imposter syndrome on top of whatever college obligations they have, plus the quest for a job. They see listings mention things like D3, Angular and Django and freeze with uncertainty. Most students are lucky if they’ve had a class mention even one of those things. This internship could mean a shining opportunity, or it could mean realizing that they’re a heap of useless and don’t know anything. No pressure.
For mentors, they have jobs and projects and deadlines and bosses. They’re doing their best to keep up with editorial demands while staying current with the latest libraries and design trends. Then, every summer a heap of applications arrive on your desk, and they all look and sound the same. Eventually, the interns arrive and need to be on-boarded (not only with the org’s CMS, but also with the team’s development environment), brought up to speed on stories and ongoing projects, and given assignments all within a few days. Plus if they screw up, it’s on you.
How can we improve our internship programs and make it a little easier on both sides? How can we increase diversity and be more realistic with our technical expectations? Let’s talk about how to make this better from application to potential hires.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by Neil Wargo</p>
        <p class="session-description">A redesign is a seemingly ever-looming cloud over any publication's web presence, a matter of when, not if. Whether it’s a simple personal blog or the web’s most trafficked sites, the underlying motivations and strategies are often the same. The goal of this group discussion is to dissect the culture surrounding the redesign to learn from one another what makes for a successful redesign, from the initial planning process to the post-mortem, with a focus on the following topics:

- Motivations and factors contributing to the decision to redesign
- Organizational and project management approaches to the discovery, design and development process
- Finding the appropriate balance of risk, innovation and user familiarity
- Surprises discovered, either along the way or after launching
- Interacting with users and accepting user feedback
- Assessing the successes and failures of a redesign after launching

        <p class="session-description">Most of us are probably already working with Git (or similar) for code, but how do we spread the benefits of working iteratively across the disciplines we work with on a day to day basis. How can we involve journalists, editors, illustrators, designers and others into the process to build amazing content together and use everyone's talents to the fullest. Do we get everyone on GitHub, explain branching, move to markdown, or is there something we can do with API's? Let's discuss how we can, and we can convince our colleagues of the benefits of, interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>

        <p class="session-description">At the end of 2014, Eric Meyer opened his Facebook feed to see an automated post marked "your year in review," with a picture of his daughter--who had died that year from a brain tumor--surrounded by clip art of partygoers, confetti, and balloons. Nobody meant to cause Meyer harm, but thoughtlessness in the design of the feature (what he termed "inadvertent algorithmic cruelty") still left him shaken. And countless other examples abound.

Of course, in the news industry, we're no strangers to accidental (and disastrous) juxtaposition: real estate ads placed next to stories on homelessness, bots that generate cringe-worthy content, and scheduled social media posts that go out during the worst kind of breaking news. In this session, we'll look at case studies of humane and inhumane design, practice identifying pitfalls in our news apps, and figure out how to care for our readers beyond just transmitting information.</p>

        <p class="session-description">*Or, how we broke the Internet to reinvent it.

Steward Brand famously said that, "On the one hand information wants to be expensive, because it's so valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time." 

Publishers are continually looking for new angles to release content. It moved from the desktop, to mobile, and now from the browser into apps. App publishers require even more control, in the last year, we have seen the proliferation of publishing change hands from just HTML/CSS/JS to Google's AMP project, Facebook Instant Articles, and Apple News. Markup has been replaced with data models, and the browser wars have evolved into social network insights.</p>

In newsrooms of old, jobs were pretty easy to understand. Reporters, Editors, photographers, illustrators.
Let's explore the best ways to make your non-tech peers and more importantly, your boss understand how you do your job.
