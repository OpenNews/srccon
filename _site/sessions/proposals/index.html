<p>Thank you to everyone who submitted a session idea for SRCCON this year! After we review each proposal, we’ll notify everyone about their session status by May 10. And between now and then, we hope reading through the proposals here helps spark ideas about how <em>you’d</em> like to participate.</p>

<p>Our call for participation form for tickets remains open as space is available, so <a href="/particpiation/form">tell us if you’d like to be there</a>.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/katiepark">Katie Park</a> and Alex Tatusian</p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Sometimes the well of ideas runs dry and we find ourselves stuck in a creative rut. If we can’t move past it, let’s try thinking sideways. Drawing inspiration from Peter Schmidt and Brian Eno’s Oblique Strategies, a card-based system that offers pithy prompts for creative thinking, we’ll discuss ways to shift our perspective in the process of brainstorming, designing and problem-solving. Some of Schmidt and Eno’s one-line strategies include:</p>

<p>“Not building a wall but making a brick.”
“Go to an extreme, move back to a more comfortable place.”
“You can only make one dot at a time.”</p>

<p>We’ll look at projects that emerged from unconventional sources of inspiration, share our favorite methods of breaking creative block and then develop our own list of “oblique strategies” that we’ll publish online after the session.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>This year we launched the project Desconfio in which we have developed a  methodology to analyze distrust electoral information.

        <div class="session-description"><p>The 2020 census is a year away, but chances are you’ve already heard about it. The census is making headlines because several states are suing the Trump administration over its plans to include a citizenship question. But much of the news glosses over why the census is important and how it affects everyone’s lives. Congressional representation is at stake, along with $800 billion in federal funds that will get disbursed for state, county, and community programs over the next decade.</p>

<p>When KPCC conducted human-centered design research into the census and the opportunities for public service journalism, one finding stood out: We can’t assume educated news consumers know the stakes or the mechanics of the census. There was a very low level of census knowledge among the people we interviewed, including current NPR listeners. How can we address this knowledge gap? We have some ideas. Let’s talk.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>In a post-Gamergate world, how should we think about personal data in our reporting and our research? What responsibilities do we have to the privacy of the communities we report on? While many journalists have <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T71OE4fm4ns0ugEOmKOY4xF4H9ikbebmikv96sgi16A/edit">struggled with this question</a>, few newsrooms have an explicit ethics policy on how they retain, release, and redact personally-identifiable information. Let’s change that, by drafting a sample PII ethics policy that can be adopted by organizations both large and small.</p>

Having a process to help in preparing, attending, and post-event knowledge sharing can help focus your attention to maximize the time you spend at conferences. In this session, we will define the common types of conference attendees and map to activities before, during, and after conferences to provide a solid framework for making conferences a must-fund part of your team’s budget. If you’ve ever come back from an event inspired and excited, but unsure how to take the next step, this session is for you.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>It’s often assumed there’s a difference between being part of an innovation team and working a beat in a traditional newsroom setting. There is much that is transferable between the two jobs. This session would explore similarities between two seemingly different functions in the modern newsroom and try to answer the following questions:  How do you bring the level of exploration and experimentation to your beat? What lessons might folks with a product manager/design background be able to share with fellow journalists to make the return easier?</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/thebestsophist">Cordelia</a> and Tina Ye</p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>We use a bazillion code words to describe how decisions are made—data-driven, data-informed, consensus-based, human-centered, testing-driven, “design by committee”, KPIs, micromanagement, the list goes on—but they all tend to gloss over the messy parts of what is actually happening between humans and the thought process behind them. How do we make sure we make the correct decision? How do we do it in a way that is collaborative and where everyone on the team is heard and bought in?</p>

<p>How do we make sure product managers and designers and developers are all on the same page? How do we make sure they’re thinking the same thing as the editors, product owners and everyone else? What do we do when there are cultural differences? How do we deal with disagreements and power dynamics within the org? Different communication styles? How do we change our minds as we learn new things? How do we center voices from historically marginalized communities? How do we go one step further and include  the communities we serve in decision-making?</p>

<p>Join Tina and Cordelia as we take a stroll through some of the theory behind facilitation methods and figure out how to make it fit into our processes.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/tangentialism">David Yee</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>We have an obligation to our teams and our companies to bring great new people into our work who can help push our teams forward, and yet interviewing candidates can feel extracurricular and rote. We need to discuss what we might be doing wrong, what the consequences are, and how to better focus our efforts when we are interviewing the people who want to work alongside us.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about how to create safe and respectful spaces in a job interview. Let’s think deeply and critically about how we spend the thirty to sixty minutes we have in the company of potential colleagues to ensure we’re learning the right things, in the right ways, for the right reasons. Let’s discuss different approaches to  advocating for a candidate you believe in, finding the person behind the candidate, questioning unconscious bias as you observe it, and teaching others how to do likewise.</p>

<p>This session is designed for both for seasoned interviewers and folks who have never done it before. Using actual interviews as a practice space and group discussion about foibles and tactics, we hope to walk away from this session with renewed focus and better, more respectful tools for getting to know a potential colleague and doing the hard work of bringing them into our newsrooms.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/jennieshapira">Jennie M Shapira</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Since ancient times, humans have used fasting as a powerful tool to enhance mental acuity. We see this from people like Hippocrates, Plato, and Benjamin Franklin, all strong supporters of fasting, to the great mathematician Pythagoras, who required that his students fast to maximize their focus. Fasting has been shown to reduce brain-fog, increase memory, improve mood, and even resist aging.  This completely free technique takes no time nor effort to do, and yields great benefits.</p>

<p>The ritual of eating 3 meals per day was introduced relatively recently, as the product of a colonial attempt to appear more “civilized.”  Break free from wasted time day-dreaming about lunch. Break free from 3pm slumps where all you can think about is a nap. Learn to harvest the focus and zen that comes from fasting, and channel it into your passions.</p>

<p>This session will be focused on learning how incorporating fasting into your lifestyle can help you get the most out of your day.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/JennHenrichsen">Jennifer Henrichsen</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Political intimidation threatens media practitioners worldwide and disinformation campaigns destabilize public trust. Journalists are under surveillance, are increasingly hacked, doxxed and harassed. Over the last several years, numerous journalists and news organizations have reported incidents in which their communications have been hacked, intercepted, or retrieved (Der Spiegel staff, 2015; Wagstaff, 2014). When journalists’ digital accounts are vulnerable to hacks or surveillance, news organizations, journalists, and their sources are at risk. These risks vary and can include financial loss, physical threats, or sources’ unwillingness to share information for fear of related consequences (FDR Group &amp; PEN America, 2013, 2015).</p>

<p>Despite these myriad concerns, many newsrooms lack the resources necessary to build robust and resilient security cultures. This session will address these concerns by documenting the needs of participants and their newsrooms. Drawing on guides like OpenNews’s “Field Guide to Security Training in the Newsroom,” participants will articulate what has worked and what hasn’t – from information security technologies to data policies – in order to identify core themes and challenges. Participants will walk away with a co-created best practices document that they can use as a starting point in their newsrooms to foster robust security cultures in a time of increasing doxing attempts, labor precarity, financial constraints, and decreasing trust in the media.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/emettely">Eimi Okuno</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Innovation is freedom to experiment. Innovation is creative and fast. Innovation is not production. Innovation in the newsroom is all of those things for BBC News Labs. As News Labs grew from a small experimental team to a full multidisciplinary team, the flexibility of “innovation” reduced our ability to communicate with each other. Will innovation be restricted by structure, when it demands flexibility to try out ideas? Is cultural change possible when the ideology of the team is synonymous to what is problematic? This session will explore these questions and how re-introducing structure - Objective Key Results (OKRs) - helped us break silos in our team.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/Cguess">Christopher Guess</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>In the modern political landscape truth is a challenging concept to fully grasp but one that is heard about from all angles. What is considered truthful, what is considered falsehoods, and how to tell one from the other, is discussed ad infinitum on TV, in op-eds, journalism schools and the halls of power. Since 2016 the words “fact checking” have been thrown about as a panacea to all of our woes, but the reality of fact checking, its actual process, and how technology is coming up to assist with it, is, mostly, fundamentally misunderstood.</p>

<p>I want to shed light on this vaguely opaque and still nascent form of journalism. How does it differ from the fact checkers that newspapers and magazines have employed for decades? How are these decisions reached? How, and if, technology and modern concepts such as artificial intelligence and machine learning can play a role in holding politicians and public figures to account. This will be the place to ask questions, figure out where different expertises can assist in the problem, and maybe even get a bit of hope for the future.</p>

We’ll examine different styles of celebrating and recognizing each other, and we’ll look at examples of how workplaces emphasize joy and gratitude as well as collective celebration. Participants will work with each other to craft a plan for how they want to mark important milestones in their own work.

        <div class="session-description"><p>Being a journalist is hard these days and awards aren’t a bad thing. But data I’ve compiled shows that the best work of the year is often backloaded into November and December, when most contest deadlines come due.  But this is also likely the least ideal time for big impactful work to come out as regular people and those with power to effectuate change leave work for the holidays.

<p>A research partner is indispensable, and the results are somewhere between journalism and science. But the experience can reveal the inner workings of scientific research.  It’s engagement where you — usually along with your audience — explore in a hands-on way the ideas you’re covering in your stories.</p>

<p>I’ll dig into the challenges and joys of partnering with researchers, and the thrills and frustrations in reporting on data from an activity you organized.</p>

<p>I’d also guide them through a brainstorming on a scientific or research collaboration they might do. Everyone will then share their projects and get some feedback.</p>

And what do you do once you get one? It can feel intimidating and overwhelming to even get started, especially if you’re the only person with your title in the newsroom. Enter peer mentorship. As coworkers from different disciplines, we’ve found that peer mentorship has helped us grow in our careers, navigate the day-to-day challenges of life at work, and get shit done.

As a bonus, you might even leave the session with a potential peer mentor from the SRCCON community!</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>Many of us work for organizations focused on the production and distribution of news and information via printed and digital formats. One thing we don’t often consider is the space this work is consumed within or the impact our work could have on the physical world.

        <div class="session-description"><p>Will automated journalism compete with human journalists? Is it a way to cut costs and replace human journalists? or would it complement quotidian journalism and journalists?  These are the questions this practical and conversational session seeks to answer. In the past few years, algorithms have been used to automatically generate news from structured data. In 2014 Associated Press, started automating the production of its quarterly corporate earnings reports.</p>

<p>Once developed, not only can algorithms create thousands of news stories for a particular topic, they also do it more quickly, cheaply, and potentially with fewer errors than any human journalist. Unsurprisingly, this efficiency has fueled journalists’ fears that automated content production will eventually eliminate newsroom jobs, however some experts see the technology’s potential to improve news quality with a human-machine alliance.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/tylrfishr">Tyler Fisher</a> and Brittany Mayes</p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Over the past few decades, newsroom technologists have pushed the field of journalism forward in countless ways. As we approach a new decade, and arguably a new era of digital journalism, how must newsroom technologists evolve to meet new needs? And how do we center technology in a newsroom while also fixing the problems news organizations have long had regarding diversity, representing their communities, speaking to their audiences, etc.?</p>

<p>In this session, we will start with a set of hypotheses to seed discussion.</p>

<p>For journalism to succeed in the next decade:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Newsroom technologists must have real power in their organizations.</li>
  <li>Experimentation and product development must be central to how a newsroom operates.</li>
  <li>News organizations must be radically inclusive of their communities.</li>
  <li>Cultivating positive culture and interpersonal relationships is key to developing sustainable newsrooms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given these hypotheses, what skills do we need to grow in newsroom technologists? What must we think about more deeply in our daily work? What tools do we need to develop? How must this community evolve? Together, let’s brainstorm these questions and leave with ideas to explore and deepen newsroom technology and culture beyond SRCCON.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>[cue Star Wars scroll …]</p>

<p>Heading into 2019, Chicago faced a historic election. For the first time in decades, the mayor’s office was up for grabs with no incumbent and no heir apparent to the 5th floor of City Hall. Meanwhile, the clerk, treasurer and entire 50-seat City Council were up for election. Competition was fierce.</p>

<p>Small newsrooms faced the daunting task of covering all of these races. More than 200 candidates were running for local office – including more than a dozen for mayor – from complete unknowns to career pols. All of this was taking place in a news environment where media often struggles to engage voters and help them make informed decisions.</p>

<p>With these challenges in mind, a group of five local independent newsrooms decided to pool their resources and work together to create a one-stop resource to serve voters. In a matter of days, the Chi.vote Collaborative was founded, launching a website with candidate profiles, articles, voter resources and other information. The collaborative grew to 10 partners and traffic to the website surged heading into the February election and eventual April runoff. We literally built the car as we drove it, rolling out new features as fast as we could develop them. All while publishing new stories and information daily.</p>

<p>We quickly learned a lot about collaborating, building on each other’s strengths and overcoming challenges. Here are our takeaways, what worked and what didn’t, along with tips, insights and all the key technical details that could help you and your collaborators cover the next election.</p>

<p>Incidents and outages are a normal part of any complex system. In recent years The New York Times adopted a collaborative method for discussing these events called Learning Reviews. We’d like to give a brief introduction to Learning Reviews—where they originated, why they’re called Learning Reviews, what they are—followed by a few exercises with the attendees. Some of these group exercises would focus on communicating the idea of complexity and how that impacts our ability to predict the future. In doing so, we’d also communicate how complex systems have a degree of impermanence and how this contributes to outages. This segues into the theme of the discussion, how do we look back on an event in a way that prioritizes learning more about our systems and less about finding fault with a human? We’ll go over the importance of language and facilitation in this process.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/HBCompass">Heather Bryant</a> and Shady Grove Oliver</p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>In a 2013 survey of doctors, researchers found that 88.3% of doctors wish to “forego high-intensity treatments” and decline resuscitation, choosing different end-of-life care for themselves than their patients. The study states “it is likely that doctors recurrently witness the tremendous suffering their terminally ill patients experience as they undergo ineffective, high intensity treatments at the end of life and they (the doctors) consequentially wish to forego such treatments for themselves.” What does journalism look like under such a lens? How would we cover the next shooting? The next devastating natural disaster? A personal tragedy? A public embarrassment? When it is us, our families, our lives, how do we want our colleagues to conduct themselves? How do we want our stories told?</p>

<p>We’ve combined our backgrounds in narrative medicine, local journalism, ethics and access research into a project examining the parallels in how health care and journalism have evolved in the U.S. Across both fields, practitioners often cite the appeal of service to others as why they do the work, but are communities truly being served? The very practices of health care and journalism are shaped, challenged, and even threatened by the compromises created by the conflict between delivering a service and seeking revenue. They both have become industries that suffer from lack of access for local or rural communities, are distorted by the drive for profit or financial influence (like insurance companies and hedge-fund owners), deeply ingrained problems with diversity and representation and questions of agency, ethics, autonomy and participation from the people on the other side of the pen and stethoscope.</p>

<p>Join us for a frank group discussion and brainstorming session around the parallels between medicine and journalism and to push toward solutions that make our communities healthier—physically, emotionally and intellectually.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/phihado">Phi Do</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Screenwriters use many techniques to distribute information throughout a film: building context to create goals and desires, withholding knowledge to create intrigue, planting clues to create suspense, and revealing discoveries to create surprise. By establishing rhythms of expectation, anticipation, disappointment, and fulfillment, a well-written screenplay keeps us captivated as it directs us through all the plot points and to the heart of the story.</p>

<p>Data journalism shares a similar goal. Are there lessons from screenwriting we can use to write engaging, data-driven stories, so we don’t end up with an info dump? Let’s find out together.</p>

<p>In this session, we’ll participate in a writers’ room to discuss how screenwriters use different strategies to jam-pack information into scenes while building a narrative and keeping pace. Then we’ll try out different screenwriting approaches to see how we can best break down complex data sets in our reporting, guide readers to the story, and keep their attention.

        <div class="session-description"><p>Feed-based architectures have long been the primary drivers of engagement for social media companies and online-first publishers. On the other hand, the digital offerings of older more mature publishers still mirror their print counterpart: Content is ordered by section and readers have no control over what they see. In this session, we want to explore if and how customizable feeds can work within a more traditional news website or app.</p>

<p>Here are some questions we want to discuss: How does one build a feed to begin with? How can users personalize it to their interests? By adopting the feed concept, are we just one step closer to trapping our readers inside their own filter bubbles? How may we responsibly use algorithms to improve the relevance of a news feed? How, if at all, can we involve editors in the process? What is good data to collect in order to power a valuable feed for readers</p>

<p>If we let the needs of community members drive the design of our election coverage, it would look dramatically different – and be dramatically better for our democratic process and social cohesion, we think. Bonus: those community members will be pretty grateful to you for unsexy coverage like explaining what a circuit court judge does. At a time when we’re pivoting to reader revenue, this public service journalism model is not just good karma – it should be seen as mission critical.</p>

And democracy!” when it comes to helping readers understand the merits of supporting our work financially. Learn how to write timely, topical appeals that rally support around your newsroom’s most impactful work. The work featured may have had an impact on a particular reporting subject or community, or it may simply be something that your team is really proud of. During this session, you’ll draft concise language that may be used to promote membership or subscriptions across your website, social media and email.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>The Washington Post’s Research, Experimentation and Development (RED) team was established four years ago with the mission to build better ad tech. RED took its baby steps operating as a startup within a large media organization but has undergone a transformation to triple in size. This session will follow the team’s progress from a ragtag group of engineers through its awkward teenage phase when growing pains made project prioritization difficult to current day when the group is hitting its stride as an adult member of the Post.</p>

<p>The two presenters, both of whom joined the team in its early phases, will talk about the types of projects they developed early on, the challenges they encountered and what made them switch from individual solutions to more sustainable platforms. They will track the adoption of an agile development mindset and discuss when it does and does not work. Finally, they will showcase the Post’s user testing lab and how the results from periodic qualitative feedback have shaped the development roadmap. This is a session for attendees who want a peek inside the Post’s research advertising arm and those who want to know how to manage a development team through significant growth. We also will discuss how R&amp;D groups at other publications can partner with RED in the ad tech and journalism space.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>While journalists talk a lot about having an impact, we’re not as forthcoming on how we can be more deliberate and active in informing structural change in our communities. Our work is often geared to spark surface-level outcomes (a law was passed, an official was held accountable, etc.), but even when media organizations are equipped to do deeper investigative work, they often don’t invest in longer-term strategies that can illuminate pathways for citizens to create more equitable, healthy systems.</p>

<p>Using a practice called systems thinking – a holistic approach to grappling with complex issues – journalists can develop more collaborative frameworks that help people build power and resiliency to address some of our most deeply rooted problems. Through the lens of systems thinking, we’ll open a discussion about some of the big ideas and questions that a change-oriented approach holds for journalists: What new roles can journalists play to help evaluate and facilitate opportunities for social change? How do we negotiate traditional journalistic principles and standards while working to actively dismantle oppressive systems? How can we better communicate and act on our values?</p>

<p>We’ll offer ideas from the systems thinking playbook, discuss examples of journalists who are actively rooting their practice in systems change and lead a visioning exercise to imagine new possibilities.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>In this session will open up the conversation to knowledge share successful open source strategies, drawing on participants questions and experience.</p>

<p>At BBC News Labs we recently open sourced a transcript editor component  (https://github.com/bbc/react-transcript-editor) using a “code in the open” / “open source from the start” approach we engaged a community around the project. This has helped us to improve the project beyond what we had initially anticipated.</p>

<p>Biggest discovery was that a lot of the key to a successful open source strategy was around the so called “soft skills”. Curating the project and communication within the contributors, drafting
documentation, guides, ADR (architecture decision record), as well as talking to contributors and learn more about their use cases, online and offline.</p>

<p>We also discovered that it was instrumental in transferring our project to a production team to scale it to the rest of the organization.</p>

<p>Will discuss what has worked, and what hasn’t worked for participants, and divide into groups to knowledge share potential open sourcing strategies.</p>

<p>This session welcomes both people who have no open source experience and are curious about how to get started as well as seasoned open source contributors/maintainers and anything in between.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>In this session, I’ll provide a comprehensive review of how you can bring a community together to build a podcast and why audio content can be valuable to local communities.</p>

<p>We’ll discuss how to focus on the news impacting your communities. You want to build trust with your listeners through respectful collaboration and give mis/underrepresented voices in the city a place where they can be heard. We’ll go over the methodologies that can build this mission into your organizational structure. Participants will learn how to create a mission statement and begin a series of task force meetings, along with how to:
-Create a listener advisory board
-Hold monthly meetings throughout neighborhoods in settings relevant to the discussion 
-Welcome locals to attend these meetings to come and share their ideas and insights for stories that the podcast should tell about their community
-Invite locals to contribute their expertise and share their experience</p>

<p>It’s important to research how your community digests news. Really think about the neighborhoods you want to cover: Who is the audience you want to build? And who is reporting it? It helps if reporters are living in that area and/or reflect the identities of that area.</p>

<p>This session will also explore how you can incorporate your listeners into the storytelling.</p>

How do you think about the visual purpose? E.g. visuals as evidence, for empathy, or an emotional journey? We also want to hear everyone’s favorite tactics for visual research: how to get the visuals or the information to make them, from crowd-sourcing, open datasets, records requests, Google Earth, to interview tips. Finally, as we all know, visual stories tend to take more time than standard stories. What’s your process? How does your newsroom think about planning, setting expectations, and scoping (and the fact that it’s possible to rush edit a half-finished text into publishable form in a day if needed but not possible to hack a half-finished code project into functional form in a day)?</p>

<p>I hope to discuss not only the challenges of starting a student-run data journalism section, but ensuring its continuity and sustaining the content it produces for the community it serves. I’m interested in talking about how to engage with the local data journalism community (having LAT Data Desk employees who used to work at Daily Bruin to train students, for example) was crucial for boosting morale. Pushing to hire diverse students with varied skill sets and different backgrounds allowed for sensitive stories and working with data and sourcing in a more human-centered way. Working with senior leaders to incorporate data literacy and accessibility in small ways, as well as working with sensitive data (for example an interactive map allowing students to document their personal experiences with sexual violence anonymously) helps push boundaries and is worth investing in, in student newsrooms.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/aschweig">Adam Schweigert</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>There are many resources out there for managers leading remote teams. Similarly, there are plenty of resources for the people on those teams to work, communicate and collaborate effectively. There are also plenty of arguments that have been made for how remote work improves employee effectiveness and satisfaction, why it has economic benefits for employers, and on and on.</p>

<p>And yet, national news organizations concentrate their staff in the most expensive cities in the country. Let’s try to figure out why that is and help make the case for supporting a more remote-friendly workforce.</p>

<p>In this session we’ll try to come up with as many of the common objections raised by hiring managers when they insist that a given position be based in a particular location and then come up with a playbook of effective arguments to overcome those objections.</p>

<p>Additionally, we’ll come up with some high level talking points regarding how supporting remote work can improve the fundamental economics of journalism while improving the lives of employees and the communities they serve.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>Art vs Science. Creativity vs Deadlines. Leading a team at a news organization requires a lot of switching  between left and right brain to get meetings scheduled but to coax the best ideas out of the team. But what happens if you get a boss who trends more to one side than the other?</p>

<p>It’s more common than you think. Especially as newsrooms create more roles that straddle technical and editorial lines. So sometimes you may need a boss to get in there and wrestle with the material with you, but they’re busy overseeing a team of 20 people. Or you want someone who will go up the chain to argue that workflow changes are needed, but they would rather code review and tweak wording.</p>

<p>If any of this sounds familiar, let’s uncover the patterns in the way we interact with our higher-ups in order to have a strategy going forward. Without judgement, let’s take stock of ourselves and the people we report to in order to find ways that lead to better work relationships.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>Marking up is the process of adding editorial context to content. Anyone who works with content does this, in ways both intuitive (like making notes in a margin) and unintuitive (like writing html). Because we do this constantly it’s easy to overlook how unintuitive our digital markup systems can be. How can we markup content in a way that both we and our digital systems can understand, while preserving our editorial intent for the future?</p>

<p>In this session, you’ll work in groups using arts and crafts to add an editorial voice to stories. You can bring your own story (please print it out!) or we’ll provide one for you. After, we’ll discuss how the choices made by technology might limit what you can express and how long your markup will last in an archival state. We have some ideas of how to balance these needs, but would like to hear your ideas as well!</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/lewispants">Lewis Raven Wallace</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>“Parachute journalism” is the practice of national outlets or freelancers flying into local communities they’re not a part of to report a story, then leaving again. It’s a part of our journalistic economy, as the money and power in journalism is focused in just a few geographic locations–but it can also be damaging to local communities, and it can lead to misrepresentation, distrust and resentment. Often, national journalists appear in a community in times of trauma and elections, and report stories with insufficient context, while local journalists struggle to access equivalent resources for necessary ongoing reporting. This session will explore our collective experiences with parachute journalism as both insiders and outsiders to a community, in order to produce good ideas about how to do harm reduction, increase accountability, and shift power dynamics. We’ll ask: Are there situations where it’s better if this story just doesn’t get told? How do we evaluate that? What can national media outlets and freelancers do to connect and collaborate with local journalists and local communities? What are the ethics of accountable partnerships? In what ways do local and regional/national media needs differ, and how can journalists collaborate to produce stories that better address the needs of all involved? All of this will be driving at a larger question: What does justice and accountability look like in the practice of journalism?</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by Angela Guo</p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>News organizations produce massive amounts of content every single day. The current political climate means relentless breaking news about the government. Newsrooms are also producing short novels’ worth of non political news, cultural criticism and other feature pieces that are not only great journalism but also important counter programming to the political coverage. At The Times, all this journalism exists online and in the paper but promoting a story on the web home page or on social really boosts a story’s reach. For many readers, the articles chosen to appear on those platforms become their main understanding of our report.</p>

<p>How do news organizations best surface content to readers? How can we use technology to aid what is ultimately an editorial decision about what stories go on the limited real estate that exists in those platforms (the home page, Twitter and FB)? As we retool our home page programming tools at The Times (and other platform programming tools soon too!), personalization and machine learning/AI to suggest content for promotion are things that have been talked about and experimented with. We want to make sure new readers get new news every time they visit our site but we also don’t want new people to miss big news. We want a good balance of politics and feature writing. And we want all of this to look and feel consistent across mobile, tablet and desktop despite the vast differences in those device displays. Mindful use of technology can help reduce the amount of friction required to keep platforms up to date and curated. But what does that look like in practice? And what are some things to be cautious about in this space?</p>

<p>In this session, we’ll walk through some simple examples of using technologies like machine learning to classify news tonally and surface content intelligently as both a technical exercise and a thought experiment. Then we’ll have a conversation. What excited you about the potentials of these technologies? What concerns do you have about applying these technologies to programming the news?</p>

These problems require radical change, but change is scary, so we often make that change in incremental ways. But incremental change tends to yield negligible benefits.</p>

<p>Instead of picking the low hanging fruit, what if we assumed there was no cost to taking immediate, decisive, and thorough action—what would we do? What if we dropped everything? In this session, we’ll air the most radical possible solutions to the problems we face and use a mental framework to pull slightly back from the impossible to the merely audacious (instead of slightly forward from the status quo). We’ll talk about how to find real opportunities to turn a corner in organizational work, create actionable plans for proposing it, and find allies and license to try it.</p>

<p>Efforts to recruit, retain, and advance more underrepresented people in engineering are critical, as are ongoing unconscious bias and psychological safety trainings. But in the meantime, there are some straightforward practices engineering teams can adopt immediately that, on the surface, have more to do with building a strong, healthy engineering culture than encouraging underrepresented engineers to thrive — but whose result is just that. One of us, an engineer, learned this through observing and reflecting on the practices of the all-male team where she made meaningful contributions and grew from a junior to a mid-level engineer. The other of us, a program manager and a leader of an interest group for Women in Tech, has experienced both teams that did and didn’t do this well.

        <div class="session-description"><p>A lot of data journalism takes place in front of a computer, but there is a lot to be gained by creating data together with your community.  As part of a documentary project about a culturally diverse, low-income community, we recently invited residents to map their neighborhood — not online, but with paper and pens at in-person gatherings. We not only generated unique data, but also stories and context we never would have heard if we hadn’t met people where they lived.</p>

<p>More and more, journalists are experimenting with community engagement practices to accurately reflect and represent people’s lived experiences. We can do the same by taking an analog approach to creating data, including our community in the stories we tell about them. This helps verify the data by collecting it ourselves and having subject matter experts (your community!) vet it along the way. It also makes our reporting process more transparent and creates a group of people invested in our work.</p>

<p>We’ll share what we did and what we learned in our neighborhood mapping experiments, and invite a discussion on other ways to weave community engagement into data reporting. Our goal: draft a starter kit of ideas for doing data journalism IRL that you can take back to your newsroom.</p>

What’s the ethically-minded technologist to do? This session will be an open, off the record conversation among designers, developers, and journalists about the things that keep us up at night: the ways our work can cause harm, the systems driving us to do the wrong thing, the incentives that make it hard to even know what’s right. We’ll work from a vantage point that assumes good intentions, recognizes that impacts matter more than plans, and acknowledges the impossibility of perfect solutions: no matter what we do, we are all complicit. But we are not alone, and we are not without the ability to effect change.</p>

We will look into the ones that our industry is offering. We will explore success and failure stories, and we will try to build the perfect subscription.
The idea of this session is to understand what is suppose to save our industry, explore its variances, recognize flaws and limitations, and discuss what could the industry be doing better.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>We don’t talk about it a lot in the newsroom, the fact that we see and hear things all the time in our jobs that likely affect us in ways it’s hard to describe to someone else. One of the first roles for most reporters and photographers is covering breaking news - chasing the police scanner from one traumatic event to the next. Our newsroom might have to cover a traumatic event on a larger scale - a mass shooting, a devastating brush fire, hurricane or tornado. We take care to tell the stories of those affected, to make sure their voices and their grief are heard. But we also need to take care of ourselves and our colleagues in these moments. What should you be looking for to make sure you’re protected and feel empowered to speak up for yourself when you don’t feel comfortable or need help? What are some things you could do if you are the editor to take care of your staff? What types of services could news organizations offer that would help in these situations?</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>Diversity initiatives are popping up in most companies these days. Newsrooms are talking about gender and race representation, re-examining how we cover stories and how we create space for employees of all genders and races. We laud ourselves for being aware and being inclusive. However, noticeably missing from the conversation, at least for those who identify as such, are people with disabilities.</p>

<p>The New York Times has employee lead initiatives to help correct that. From the tech task force that turned into a team designated with making our site more accessible, to the internal panel on employees with disabilities that turned into an employee resource group the disabled community and their allies at the times are standing up and taking space.</p>

<p>During this session we will examine how the disability community is represented in newsrooms and institutions, discuss what has been done, and set a framework for how to take action now. We will work together to figure out what ally-ship looks like and what it means for diversity initiatives to include people with disabilities, and how they miss the mark when they don’t – both for employees and our coverage.</p>

<p>It really should be that simple but there is so much to disagree on that its hard to know where to start.</p>

<p>How do we even measure performance? How do you measure that? When you account for all the different ways that people access the same articles and news sites with different hardware, browsers, and connection speeds, internet congestion, and from different parts of the globe - the question and answer get thornier. We’ll go deep on that.</p>

<p>Setting that aside, why should you care? What are the user-experience implications and the business implications between slow and fast pages? What are the consequences to the reader? Short answer: Lots of good reasons.</p>

That’s partly because we don’t use the right tools or frameworks to encourage clear and consistent communication. At WhereBy.Us we’ve used three tools– user manuals, weekly team health checks and personal OKRs– that help every person in our organization share with their colleagues how they work best with others, how they’re feeling at the end of a week, and what personal goals they want to work toward.

Sometimes it can be an individual, sometimes it can be several people. That’s how things happened where we work. Scattered efforts led to mixed degrees of success. But coalescing these efforts into a more formal grassroots team has been a game-changer. Our group — the Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (DIB) team — started with just a few employees. Since last summer, it has grown to include volunteers from most departments, representatives from HR and recruiting, and support from the company founders. With this session we’ll share lessons from our experience, but primarily hear from others what has worked well and what hasn’t.</p>

<p>Our goal is for participants to leave this session energized with actionable ideas and plans to increase diversity, inclusion, belonging and equity within their own organizations.

If one ZIP code has 30 homeless individuals out of 100, and another has 30,000 homeless out of 100,000, the percentages indicates similarity, but the two geographies will have vastly different times dealing with the homeless population. When looking at a list of percentages, we should endeavor to find those that are distinct. Tools from statistical theory can help us tease out what’s unusual and what isn’t.

        <div class="session-description"><p>During the 2018 election, micro-financing of campaigns up-and-down the ticket exploded. Small dollar donations have been a dominant force in politics since the Obama campaign in 2008, but in 2018, that finally reached the local level (from congressional races to district attorney races and everything in-between) in a real way. Powered by grassroots groups, candidates began to draw a high volume of donations of $50 and less from people that live nowhere near the areas they represent.</p>

<p>Journalism has lessons to learn from the 2018 election. Principally, in the hunt for new revenue, identifying small dollar donors that care about your mission can be a potential outlet for financing journalism in markets around the country. Is there a way for locally-focused organizations to build up an audience of revenue-generating customers that live outside of the areas they serve?

        <div class="session-description"><p>Companies often lament that they are trying to hire a more diverse community of engineers, but that they struggle to find strong candidates. But if companies want to hire more diverse candidates, they need to be open to the idea of hiring people with diverse educational backgrounds: people without college degrees, people who are self-taught, and people who went to a boot camp.</p>

<p>Newsrooms and product organizations that are reluctant to hire candidates from non-traditional educational backgrounds eliminate a host of candidates right off the bat. How can teams and managers become more confident in non-traditionally educated engineers? If employers were better aware of what knowledge these engineers may not have, they could prepare both these new engineers and their current team, fostering an environment more easily able to absorb this kind of talent.</p>

<p>I want to talk with engineers from non-traditional educational backgrounds about the things they encountered that “everyone seemed to know”. What did they get stuck on starting their first job but were too embarrassed to ask? I want to talk with hirers about their experiences hiring first time professional engineers, and some of the things that have held them back from doing so.

<p>Let’s brainstorm about ways to self-educate for new work situations that might help with these beginnings – and what kinds of support we might ask for from the people we work with and the organizations we work in. Come with any examples of what’s helped you – or what hasn’t – when taking on something new.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>Have you ever heard the saying that you’re the average of the five people that you spend the most time with? Well, that may or may not be true, but it does prompt some useful reflection. Who do you spend the most time with while at work (in person, or remotely), and do they support you? Also what if you thought really hard and couldn’t even come up with a list of five people? Well, you pitch a SRCCON session of course, and ask people to help you and others discuss ways to find (and keep) your work crew.</p>

<p>In this session we’ll discuss:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you don’t already have “your people”, what can you do about it? Where are they and how can you find them?</li>
  <li>What if you do have a network, but you don’t reach out to them enough because you’re worried about “bothering” them? Are they really your people then?</li>
  <li>If you don’t already have people, who do you vent to? Who do you learn from? Who do you take cues from?</li>
  <li>And further, should you ever strong-arm your way into an existing group? How does that go? Is it even a good idea?</li>
  <li>What if you’ve recently moved, switched jobs or taken on a new role inside your company? Do you find new people, keep your old crew, or maintain both?</li>
</ul>

<p>These topics and more will be discussed, and people can share their experiences, best (and worst!) practices for finding their network and finally realizing that everyone belongs somewhere (phew!)</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/_isaaclj">Isaac Johnson</a> and Joe Germuska</p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>More than a decade ago, much of the web world was infatuated by the promise of the “semantic web,” a vision of seamless connections between data on independent systems. But before long, that vision seemed caught up in overly-complex abstractions and doomed to obscurity.
Meanwhile, a combination of technology growth and recalibrated expectations may have set the stage for a new approach to achieving these goals. Wikipedia, better known for its collaborative, volunteer-written articles, has also incorporated its sister project Wikidata for structuring data in its pages and disambiguating names with stable identifiers. And, the Schema.org standards group has come up with simpler ways for web publishers to make their intentions explicit, empowering application developers to work with that information without needing Google-scale resources.
In this session, we’ll look at these two developments. We’ll provide a practical introduction to working with Wikidata and its related APIs and datasets, and, we’ll discuss what might be possible if structured data was more completely baked into our research, articles, or web applications.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/anjdelgado">Anjanette Delgado</a> and Jun-Kai Teoh</p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>How would we do journalism differently if we were to think about impact — real-world change — at the brainstorming stage, before we started to write or shoot? If we knew something needed to happen to make things better, could we identify a few levers to pull that’d make that something more likely? Would we frame the story differently? Share the data openly? Talk to different sources? And how do we do all of this without going too far, without crossing into advocacy journalism? Now more than ever, with more nonprofit newsrooms forming, more for-profit newsrooms turning to consumer revenue (on the sales pitch that journalism matters) and trust at a crisis point, we need to measure and show why our work matters. This session will cover published examples and studies but is meant to be a discussion about what we can do — and what’s going too far — to make a difference. We might also, using design thinking strategies, prototype a project designed for impact.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/@kristenhare">Kristen Hare</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Work/life balance is impossible - most of us “work” more than we “life,” and a lot of us are lucky enough to love that work. Trying to balance it all leads to burnout, resentment and ideals and expectations that never get met. There’s a better metaphor, one that takes into account all the elements of your life, helps you figure out what drives you and come up with strategies to protect it. It’s called work/life chemistry.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/pierreconti">Pierre Conti</a> and Jonathan Stray</p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Workbench is an open source tool that puts all stages of the data journalism process in one workspace, including scraping, cleaning, monitoring, and visualization – all without coding, and all reproducible. 
In this hands-on tutorial, you’ll learn how to use Workbench for several different newsroom tasks. Clean and explore data, monitor sources, create live embeddable charts that update when new data is released, or automate useful queries and workflows that other journalists can use to report. Workbench is built to help make data tasks accessible to more people in the newsroom.
This session is good for journalists of all skill levels.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by Eric Sagara and Cheryl Phillips</p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Come join Big Local News for a discussion on how newsrooms can work together to grow regional and national datasets from local reporting. We are in the midst of building out a platform for newsrooms to share not only data, but story recipes and methodologies. We want to use the great work being done in data-driven, accountability journalism to inspire others in small and large newsrooms throughout the country.</p>

<p>We’ve already begun. Earlier this year Big Local News released an update to a database of police traffic stops, collected and standardized from dozens of different police agencies around the country. The release was the result of a partnership with the Stanford Computational Policy Lab and timed to around a pre-NICAR workshop where we taught journalists how to analyze the data to uncover patterns in racial disparity.</p>

<p>We also started a conversation at NICAR centered around a coordinated effort to collect more police data. We want to expand on that conversation now. What other datasets can we be collecting in health care, education and other important local topics? How can we help local newsrooms not only collect data, but analyze and archive it for others to work with? And how do we incentivize such efforts? What obstacles are there to building a cooperative environment where data is shared freely between newsrooms and how do we overcome them? And lastly, what features would you like to see in a platform that would facilitate this effort?</p>

<p>Come help us answer these questions and build a network to collect and sharing data for use in accountability journalism. And if you have data to share, bring that too.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/moizsyed">Moiz Syed</a> and Akil Harris</p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>There are a few examples of web development, design, non-profit and advocacy organizations that have non-traditional organizational structures but almost all digital newsrooms have adopted organizational structures that mimic the traditional top-down structures of old.  These structures mimic the problems of old media organizations, problems that come from when people in power thrive on telling as little as possible to their employees before making significant editorial or business choices.</p>

<p>In this session, we want to have a conversation with SRCCON participants about what other organizational structures should be explored that could encourage the decision-making power to be shared equally amongst the members of the organization.</p>

<p>We want to talk about the pros and cons of building a newsroom co-op where every member could have an equal-voting power to make editorial and financial decisions. Such an organization would also have its own limitations and we want this discussion to be a frank conversation about what those could be and how we could work around them.</p>

<p>For a part of the session, we want to break into small groups to think about how they would organize their ideal organization. How will they be structured, what their goals and missions be, how will they be funded and what topics would they cover. We want the participants of this session to leave with a sense of hope that another world is possible.</p>
