        <h2 class="session-title"><a href="#proposal-106924">Coping Mechanisms for Skills and Careers <span class="permalink">&para;</span></a></h2>
        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/tiffehr">Tiff Fehr</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Let's discuss tactics and challenging questions regarding how we cope with tech and journalistic uncertainty in our jobs and careers.  Let's set aside imposter syndrome as quick as we can and discuss actively (re)shaping crummy projects, layered feedback and plateaued feelings into active learnings.  Part of that is intentionally *unlearning* habits — both skill and attitudes that stick.  Another facet is accommodating how we each learn differently — how to judge what stuff can percolate and what needs immediate patching.</p>

        <h2 class="session-title"><a href="#proposal-106215">Mundane Programming <span class="permalink">&para;</span></a></h2>
        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/dancow">Daniel Nguyen</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Programming creates so many technical and creative inventions that it's natural for aspiring programmers to dream of big projects in the cloud. But this ambition ignores the actual goal of programming, which is almost completely about making machines do mundane work. And it is counterproductive to learning how to program, which requires consistent practice as in every other form of literacy and art. 
 
So this session will be about mundane programming. Programming not to be the next Zuckerberg, or to get a better job 3 months from now, but to make today or just the next ten minutes more enjoyable. Instead of focusing specifically on how to code, we'll expand upon the reasons of why we code (though seeing is often believing when it comes to code, so feel free to bring both ideas and Gists). And we'll trim the personal prerequisites of programming, which don't include being an entrepreneur, having a profitable idea, building a website, contributing to open source, or changing the world or your career. Programming can be learned, and done, with a willingness to learn and a wide variety of small problems to practice upon.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/YAN0">David Yanofsky</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">We gave a couple people in our newsroom training in Adobe Illustrator and our graphics style guide and set them loose to make their own graphics. Let's talk about how terrifying that is and what there is to keep them making great work with the new skills.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/creativecomm">michelle cadieux</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Is journalism dying to our short attention spans? Love it or hate it, many people get their news by social media. Overview of social media campaign tracking metric tools. And the million dollar question, how does that support existing business models or make money on it's own.</p>

    <div class="session-proposal" id="proposal-105889">
        <h2 class="session-title"><a href="#proposal-105889">Kite mapping for fun and profit! <span class="permalink">&para;</span></a></h2>
        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/hyper_linda">Linda Sandvik</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Like the outdoors? Aerial photography? Documenting illegal deforestation in central America or mapping relief efforts after a natural disaster? Maybe kite mapping is for you. Sure, all the cool kids are using drones. But when journalists get arrested for trespassing when they are using their shiny + easy to spot drone to film correctional facilities, their colleague flying a kite is less likely to be stopped (what, I'm just flying my kite?). Let's make a kite and go for a walk around a Minneapolis lake or two. (Note: this requires some wind. But fear not, if there is no wind the backup plan is to do (helium) ballon mapping instead. Still cheaper than a drone). After kite-flying we'll have a look at the photos, stitch them together, contribute it Open Street Map and talk about some cool kite mapping projects.

(this workshop will work over two days, day 1 mapping (a couple of hours), day 2 do some stuff with computers)</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewwatson">Andy Watson</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Protecting yourself and your important information safe when reporting on stories either overseas in dangerous areas or when the subject of your reporting is a dangerous criminal gang can be intimidating.  It's something Brian Krebs has written about a number of times and it made me wonder if reporters and sources are fully prepared to face challenges like trumped up charges based on forged evidence given to police, financial fraud etc...

In this session, I'd like to discuss methods for protecting yourself and your family both at home and abroad.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/dataeditor">Steven Rich</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Machine learning is suddenly the new, hip thing in data journalism. But like every tool in a toolbox, it has some uses but is not a go-to tool in every situation. This session will look at how some journalists have used machine learning and in what situations it's best and in what situations it should be avoided.</p>
