        <div class="session-description"><p>Where do people find time to nurture long-term goals? How do we get past treading water at work and move toward what we want next? And how do we even figure out what that is when we’re overwhelmed and overworked? In this session, building on what we explored at SRCCON:WORK, we’ll dig into how to create space for longer term goals, and brainstorm specific ways to balance the short and long term in our daily lives. </p>

<p>How would you describe the purpose of your session? What would you love participants to leave with? We want people to leave with actionable techniques for identifying and pursuing goals — and feel empowered to to prioritize their own growth.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>If you’ve taken a long vacation, family leave or a new job, you’ve likely written some kind of passoff document to let others know where you left off with important projects and who to ask for key information.

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesturk">James Turk</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Open States has been a major civic tech project for over eight years.  The rate at which it became Sunlight’s most-used API demonstrated a clear thirst for accessible information on state legislative information in the civic tech &amp; journalism communities.  Two years ago the project became independent, and is now run as a volunteer project.</p>

<p>The goal of this session is to discuss how Open States and other state legislative projects can improve to be as useful as possible to the wider community.  Open States grew as an Open Source project with over 100 collaborators, many from newsrooms- and we want to have a conversation to help determine the right direction for the now mature project in the years to come.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>What drives people to pay for journalism? Is it access to exclusive content? Incentives in the UX? Affordability? Attitudes and beliefs? Or is it something else? Together we’ll work through some universal ways of thinking about compelling people to support journalism with money. The session will begin with brainstorming to identify the reasons people pay for journalism. We’ll sort those ideas to find common themes that - surprise! - exist in any news organization, whether its focus is global, local or something in between. We’ll end with an exercise to develop ideas for real-world implementation so that everyone leaves the room with at least one concrete plan that they think will get their readers to pay for news.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>Recently, Current wrote a call-to-action article on developing cross-newsroom collaboratives.</p>

<p>Using this article as a template, we propose to lead a session aimed at creating a Newsroom Collaborative Manifesto.</p>

<p>We hope to create not only a single session, but a group of people with a continuing dedication to answering questions like:
- How does collaboration work at national, regional and local levels?
- How does collaboration work between commercial and public media?
- What platforms can collaboratives use to communicate?
- What platforms can we use to share collaborative materials?
- How do you pitch collaboration to an unwilling management team?
- How do you collect analytics from collaborations and how do you measure success?</p>

Calling data analysts, bot builders, machine learning experts and anyone who cares about making a more inclusive report. Share the tools and techniques for measuring diversity in your news report that have been successful. Bring some ideas for things that you’d love to have but don’t have the time or resources to make. Let’s get inspired, set some accountability goals and help each other create more diverse and inclusive news reports.</p>

Whether you work for a nonprofit, small local paper, or start-up without capital, let’s come together and discuss free and low-cost services that can be used to streamline the publishing process. The focus will be on internal communication, editorial workflow, and project management, but creative solutions for analytics, social media, etc. are welcome too. At the end of the session, we will have a list of tools, services, and ideas that can be shared with the larger journo community.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>Are you a researcher (academic, policy or otherwise) who has collaborated with journalists to bring your work to a wider public forum? Are you a journalist who has helped interpret research findings and data sets in innovative public ways?  Are you both or neither but want to be?</p>

<p>Through discussion and activities we’ll envision new relationships between research teams, data journalists, and the public.  We’ll talk about our experiences with these types of collaborations, what has and hasn’t worked, and how we might upend the the traditional one-way flows from research -&gt; journalism -&gt; public.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/emersongreg">Greg Emerson</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>A number of Hollywood stars have gotten behind Frances McDormand’s public commitment to include an “inclusion rider” in her contract to hold the organization she works for to guarantee a standard of diversity in their staffing, representation and the like. </p>

<p>While most journalists don’t have the luxury of that kind of bargaining power, unions do, and newsrooms can get together to demand the organizations they work for to not only meet a diversity-inclusion standard but also to ensure representative and non-biased coverage. </p>

<p>From photo selection (like <a href="https://rollingout.com/2018/02/16/chicago-sun-times-accused-racist-coverage-stonemason-douglas-shooting/">questionable uses of mugshots of black people</a>) to sexist headline wording, holding news organizations to a high standard of respect and treating all people with dignity is good for business as well as for society.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/acnatta">Andre Natta</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Trust is a buzzword throughout journalism and society. Journalists and the communities we serve wonder how much trust we have available to give. This is important in a world where we see a never-ending battle for attention. It might need us as a profession to be more open to being vulnerable to society. It doesn’t necessarily have to be an uncomfortable or robotic interaction.   </p>

<p>This session will explore how to be more vulnerable as an individual and with your news team. We’ll also discuss how we can do so with the communities we attempt to serve with our journalism.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>Datasette is a free tool for publishing structured data to the web in a way that makes it easy to search and explore. Datasette also provides a JSON+SQL API for quickly building apps and visualizations on top of the data.</p>

<p>This workshop will provide an in-depth exploration of Datasette - what it is, the philosophy behind it and how to use it to explore and publish interesting data.</p>

<p>It will  also be a hands-on tutorial. Example data will be provided, but if you can bring your own data (ideally as CSV but other formats will work fine as well) you’ll be able to analyze, visualize and publish it during the course of the session.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/@mattmoehr">Matt Moehr</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Every data project I’ve ever done has included at least one spreadsheet. I suspect it’s the same for a lot of analysts and news nerds. We love spreadsheets, and paradoxically, we dream of a world where there are no more spreadsheets. This session will explore two broad approaches to spreadsheets. </p>

<p>First, you can treat spreadsheets as slightly nicer CSVs: no highlighting, no formulas, no auto-filtering, no subtotals. This approach is best for importing and exporting to R, Python, JSON, etc. The second approach tries to maximize the functionality of spreadsheets. Maybe even using PivotTables? I’ll try to summarize the two approaches and then lead a discussion on how our orgs approach spreadsheets. What are our spreadsheet horror stories? Do any of our organizations use versioning and code tests on their spreadsheets? Does it work? What do people find works well for getting data into and out of spreadsheets? What are alternatives for different spreadsheet functions (e.g. data entry into Survey Monkey, Google Sheets, or sqlite).</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/alleyco">Margaret Schneider</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alleyco">Ivana Wong</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Journalism asks us to be masters of all trades: writers, editors, designers, and developers alike. This hands-on workshop gives participants a chance to engage in and learn how to facilitate activities we use to build out projects from kickoff to product plan, such as on a website redesign or when developing a new editorial product. Bring ideas for projects you’re just considering, especially difficult ones—our exercises will give you a chance to air them to the group, while teaching you how to ask the right questions and really listen to the answers. We get everyone actively involved using Post-its, a “how might we” exercise in which participants frame project goals using a question format, live dot-voting with stickers, scrum-style collaborative group prioritization and planning poker, sketching, and more. </p>

<p>These sessions rapidly move teams from goal-setting and prioritizing to identifying requirements and even starting nascent deliverables such as a sitemap or sketches. You will learn well-tested strategies for putting your existing narrative skills to work, as we lead you through exercises that will help your team break down and conceptualize next steps. These activities provide ways to iterate quickly while ensuring everyone has a voice in the process. Not only will you turn Post-its and drawings into an immediately actionable backlog, you’ll also come out of our session ready to iterate on this process to improve idea generation for everyday work. In addition to creating a valuable product, these collaborative exercises build team relationships, improve your editorial collaboration and cross-functionality, and establish trust—while delivering results on deadline.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>Taking on managerial roles can be a chance to have a bigger say and influence in how your organization functions, but new managers are not always set up to succeed. How can organizations (and fellow managers) do a better job of ensuring individuals have all the tools they need to navigate the new dynamics that come with new responsibilities (and typically new titles)? Sometimes new managers still have production obligations, and how do you balance the need to still be a producer and a leader? How do you navigate the interpersonal dynamics of suddenly having newfound authority, potentially a significant dynamic change on your team?</p>

<p>As two folks who have recently moved more and more into decision making roles, we’ll talk about our respective experiences, and give others a chance share their stories and suggestions.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>Help us brainstorm tactics, tricks and tools to make sure you thrive in your career and live up to your aspirations.

        <div class="session-description"><p>OK, that title needs work. But the concept is solid, I think: Retrospectives help engineering teams get better at their work, so can they help make our strategies and best practices more effective? Of course they can.</p>

<p>In this guided workshop, let’s hold some retrospective teardowns on strategic plans from years past (think: the social media plan you put together for your boss in 2012). Let’s challenge our old assumptions of what spaces were the ones to get into, which trends would ensure the future success of our business or products. </p>

<p>A retrospective exercise like this will give you a framework to develop a truly living, breathing strategic vision. One with a past, and with the wisdom of age.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/tangentialism">David Yee</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>The practice of interviews in your daily collaboration with coworkers—whether in mentorship conversations, working with or as managers, moderating panels, conducting user research, or building products—is an incredibly valuable craft to hone. Engaging in a dialogue built on questions (especially at the intersection of journalism and technology) can help you better understand the people on your teams and surface the stories that inform their lived experiences—using those experiences to help you make smarter decisions and build better and more thoughtful products. </p>

<p>Let’s discuss how to: build constructive listening skills, use different classes of questions to guide and evaluate conversation, build a line of reasoning from a conversation as it evolves, and frame really productive interviews in service of getting to know your subject. Participants will spend time both asking and responding to questions in unstructured interviews, and we’ll reflect as a group on the practice and outcomes. At the end, you should walk away from this session not just with the tools you need to start building interviews into your daily work, but with a keener understanding of the skill of intense, focused listening.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/joegermuska">Joe Germuska</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>While our information ecology has changed wildly in the last 30 years, the processes and objectives of many news organizations have barely shifted. The forms may be novel, but often the focus is still on generating more stories, despite the glut of content vying for our attention.</p>

<p>In this session, we’ll use the “Jobs to be Done Theory” (Christensen, et al) to think bigger about what we could be doing in news organizations. The theory proposes that, rather than “churn out mediocrity” with stale innovation processes, we should begin by asking, when a customer chooses a new product or service, “what job did you hire that product to do?” </p>

<p>After a very brief presentation to set things up, we’ll go through a series of exercises, generating a catalog of jobs people need done and possible ways that news organizations could refocus their expertise to help people get those jobs done. When we’re finished, we should have a boatload of ideas for new ways to serve our audiences. Maybe you’ll even want to work with Knight Lab in the future to flesh out the ideas and develop prototypes!</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>We’ve built (but as of writing not widely announced) an open source approach to managing our complex content in an elegant, extensible way. We’d like to share, compare, and contrast that approach with others (e.g., the New York Times have recently announced a similar effort, and a lot of concordant work is being done by folks like Pietro Passarelli and the BBC), and discuss the opportunities that this has opened for us, as well as host a conceptual discussion about some of the assumptions that we’ve collectively made about HTML, Markdown, and what questioning some of those might mean for what we can do as journalists and the technologists who support them.</p>

<p>In some ways, this is a boring topic and the assumption is that it’s kind of a done deal, but what we’ve found is that simple assumptions about technology and a lack of agility around these issues has held back our collective ability to present rich, responsive media on the web (and other platforms) in a reproduceable and user-friendly way.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>Over the past several years, data analytics has been incorporated into newsroom decision making. Yet, quantitative web data can only give us a snapshot into what is happening – not why. Interviews, focus groups and surveys — commonly referred to as customer research – is a necessary tool for those in newsrooms to deepen their understanding of their audience and consider the “why” behind the “what.” In this session, we will give you an overview of different user research techniques, the pros/cons of each and when they should be deployed to the best effect.</p>

<p>We will have an example product that requires additional audience insight and together we will devise a research methodology for user testing.  Following this, we will break out into smaller groups, where we will write a script and practice conducting user interviews (or focus groups, depending on attendance) and get feedback on how we could improve our approach to get better insights.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/tweetAtIsaac">Isaac White</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/brittbinler">Britt Binler</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>You probably leverage existing tools as a part of your everyday workflow. You might be completely satisfied if they solve a specific problem or are designed for a unique use case, but what if you have a general, widely used tool that doesn’t include specific features your newsroom needs? How can you ensure your solution is something people will actually use? We encounter these questions frequently at The New York Times, and we’ve learned that not only is it usually too much work to build something completely new to replace an old system, but also it can be difficult to get users to give up an interface that they are comfortable with. As a result, we often build tools that extend the existing system, but might not live inside of it. A browser extension, a bookmarklet, or a separate UI layer that sits on top of another system – we use all of these solutions to streamline existing workflows in the newsroom. </p>

<p>But what makes a good tool anyway? And with so many potential areas for improvement, how do you know where to invest? Many of our most successful tools rely on leveraging known UIs and ways of working. We’ll discuss several tools developed at The New York Times that solve some of these problems and ask the room about their own experiences streamlining newsroom workflows.</p>

<p>After our discussion, we’ll break into small groups to collectively identify opportunities and ideate tools that build on workflows used in other newsrooms. We’ll crowdsource known issues and navigate scenarios where News Nerds answer the question: How can we solve problems using systems our users already know well?</p>

<p>No matter your level of expertise, having a skilled pair of eyes thoroughly scan your code, design, or writing is a crucial step in producing quality journalism. Enter the role of editor. Having a good editor is a truly amazing experience. Not only can a good editor help point out the errors in the text or the flaws in a design, but they can also offer guidance on story structure, layout, etc). Their feedback can make the difference between an average piece and an impactful piece.</p>

Each will be assigned a new media project (an emerging story format, an AI news app, etc.). But the deliverable will not be the product itself. It will be a draft of a high-level plan of action. That plan will define each team member’s role, their working relationship with others, and their responsibilities at different stages of the project.

It’s not that we’re bad at our jobs. It’s because being “mobile first” is surprisingly hard to do. </p>

<p>Developing for news means meeting readers wherever they might be, on whatever device they may be using — new or old, small or large, fast or slow. As projects grow more ambitious, it’s more and more challenging to support the full diversity of reader experiences.</p>

<p>There are plenty of existing platforms that aim to help make the mobile development process more robust and efficient. However, these tools are geared towards the typical case of mobile development, where a developer has fine-grained control over a website or app at the platform level.

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolelzhu">Nicole Zhu</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>We’re constantly talking about ways to “level up” our skills, advance a side project, or turn a side hustle into your full-time job. But not every side project translates to a career, and not every hobby needs to be a side hustle. In this session, we’ll discuss what makes each of these categories unique and necessary, but also brainstorm ways to evaluate whether a certain activity or project should be a hobby, a side hustle, or a career. How do you optimize for where you are, and where it’s ok to be? When should you get paid for something and when should you do it for yourself? What do you do when you’re gaining or losing energy and momentum? What if we didn’t equate not excelling with failing?</p>

<p>Let’s discuss ways to reflect and check in with ourselves (and each other) in order to strike a balance in each of these areas and detect burnout when it’s avoidable.</p>

We’ll review some of MPP’s user research materials and findings, and then create opportunities for workshopping and small team exercises focused on designing the right membership program and offerings for your space and organization.</p>

<p>We’ll touch on topics including: message tone and frequency, what to send people and when, choosing the right technology platform, potential costs, legal considerations, as well as common pitfalls and tactics for overcoming them.

        <div class="session-description"><p>It happens all the time. We parachute into a community for a short time because something “newsworthy” happens rather than coming in to stay and maintain a steady relationship.

Think of the minority areas of our communities that remain underserved, underrepresented and without coverage aside from tragedies. </p>

<p>How do we put down the ripcord and instead pull up a chair in these communities? </p>

<p>Let’s spend some time learning how to do a baseline assessment of our news organization’s coverage of diverse communities using analytics tools we already use everyday to identify blind spots. Let’s arm ourselves with actionable strategies we can use when we return to our newsrooms and can use to have these difficult conversations about our coverage’s shortcomings with top decision-makers. And finally, let’s devise a set of best practices to engage diverse communities in the interim between news events and build lasting future relationships.</p>

<p>What are the steps in analyzing and visualizing economic or markets data? How do you make sure you understand the data? What is the role of a narrative in the formation of a graphic? How do you do the research and formulate an idea? One strategy is to “interview’ reporters who cover these subjects to deepen your understanding before you speak with other sources.</p>

<p>Which is the right chart type for your data (open discussion time). None of this is new, it’s constantly tossed around and yet, but rarely settled. Do the rules change when the presentation goes from static to interactive? What about scales? What are the benefits of small multiples?</p>

<p>And we’ll discuss the critcal role of the CVL token, which is not only the mechanism by which our community will connect with the Ethereum blockchain. The token also allows us to economically incentivize actions that result in quality journalism in Civil’s marketplace, and to make it prohibitively difficult — and expensive — for bad actors and trolls to emerge.</p>

With the attention on Facebook and the advent of European GDPR regulations, the digital ads marketplace sits on a knife’s edge. For the first time in nearly a decade the user-data-driven targeted-programmatic ad space is in real danger. But also open to real change. Now is the moment for intelligent publishers to put a hand back on the wheel and reassert their ethical imperative in the next generation of ad tech.</p>

<p>We will be bringing a proposed draft for API-driven advertising to this session. We’ll run through what we have, the thinking behind it and the types of products we believe the API schema can drive. We’ll end the session by sitting down with participants and working through criticism and ideas for alterations. Our goal is to build a schema that content management systems and advertising back ends can share, allowing different publishers and third parties to communicate server to server. Then at the end of the session we’ll take the beta version of the JSON schema and open source it on GitHub.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>As a graphics editor, I see maps and charts all the time that, to their detriment, fail to follow conventional rules of visualization. Categorical data is thrown together on a line chart; bar charts aren’t grounded from a 0 baseline; three-dimensional pie charts have exploded. Data journalism and visualization has gained a lot of attention over the last decade, and many of us at this conference have scrambled to build and understand the ground rules of sound data reporting. Because of this, terrible vis has become a punchline, and Twitter amplifies the performance of calling out flaws, corrections and grievances. This isn’t limited to charting; it also happens with data analysis and journalism as a whole.</p>

<p>Of course, calling out misinformation and negligent reporting is necessary, but quibbling over personal preferences or imperfections can be discouraging and downright shaming. Behind every editorial piece is a human, and this business is smaller than we think. It can be personally devastating to have your professional work mobbed on social media.</p>

<p>Criticism that is presented thoughtlessly creates a culture for many that discourages exploration, which is vital for our respective fields. How can we be kinder and more effective in our public critiques? How can we do better for ourselves and each other? Come for the war stories, stay for the positive vibes.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>Do I use “display” or “position” for that? Sometimes you just want to make sure your newsroom tool does it’s job and not have to worry about what it looks like. Well, your days of worrying about front-end design could soon be over. Slack’s suite of API’s are vast and the documentation is one of the best of any API out there. In this session, I’ll quickly demo most of the different methods of interaction available with Slack’s APIs. We’ll build a simple graphics request form together as a group. When that’s finished, we’ll brainstorm ideas for other newsroom tools and discuss how our front-end needs could be met by one or more of the methods we’ve seen so far. We’ll be using Flask to do it, so basic Flask and Python knowledge will be required.</p>

<p>Slack has a number of features you might need from a front-end design already included. Unprompted function calls? Slack has slash commands. Do they support arguments? You bet they do. Filling out forms? Slack’s got that too. Giving personal user feedback when a script runs? Ephemeral messages make sure that only a single user can see the notification without ever having to leave the channel. Learn about all these and more in the session.</p>

A man recently threw me into confusion by rudely asking me “How, if you please, do you know, what sort of things are beautiful and ugly? For, come now, could you tell me what the beautiful is?”  I was at a loss and could not answer him properly.
Come, then, Hippias, let me rehearse:  I shall say that if a beautiful person is beautiful, there is something by reason of which he or she would be beautiful.
“How charming you are, Socrates!” he will say. “But is not a beautiful horse beautiful, which even the god praised in his oracle?”
What shall we say, Hippias? How could we dare to deny that the beautiful thing is beautiful?</p>

<p>HIPPIAS:
Quite true, Socrates, for very beautiful horses are bred in our country.</p>

<p>SOCRATES:
“Very well,” he will say, “and how about a beautiful lyre? Is it not beautiful?”
Shall we agree, Hippias?</p>

<p>HIPPIAS:
Yes.</p>

<p>SOCRATES:
After this, then, the man will ask, I am sure, “You most excellent man, how about a beautiful pot?”</p>

<p>HIPPIAS:
What an uncultivated fellow!</p>

<p>SOCRATES:
That’s the kind of person he is, Hippias, not elegant, but vulgar, thinking of nothing but the truth.</p>

<p>– Liberal paraphrasing of Plato’s <em>Hippias Major</em>, 286d - 288e</p>

<p>It’s hard enough for many of us to just explain what we do for a living; how could we expect people outside our field to understand that there’s actually beauty in it?  Because there is, isn’t there?</p>

<p>Let’s gather for a little symposium on the subject. We will start with a few presentations by fellow attendees on concrete examples of beauty they have discovered in their own work: a perfect one-liner, an exquisite pivot table, an interface that brings harmony to an unruly application.  Then we’ll open the floor to more examples and discussion.  </p>

<p>We will enjoy the beauty of watching each other describe the beautiful, and find courage to share our own unsung experiences of beauty.  We’ll draw connections between beauty in our fields and others.  We’ll resolve to dig around in our old work for treasures.  We’ll consider ways we can keep our most beautiful creations close by in our everyday work, as private inspiration and affirmation.</p>

The Chicago Data Collaborative was a test to see if, together, news organizations, researchers, advocacy groups and civic technologists were greater than the sum of their parts. Today, the Chicago Data Collaborative is working to access data from public agencies, and then organize, document, and link that data together to help understand Chicago’s criminal justice system.</p>

Do you admire the journalists you collaborate with and their innate storytelling abilities, but resent when they assume that “fix” is going to be “easy”?</p>

<p>In this intersection of tech and journalism, journalists have to work with developers, data journalists have to work with designers; while product managers, producers and editors try to translate between them all. It can be frustrating to figure out how to do this well and not silently stew. We’ll work through the struggles with understanding and identify how to foster better collaboration and bridge communication gaps. </p>

<p>Though newsrooms are working on innovative new projects with these teams more than ever, it can be difficult to know how to work with people whose skills you might not understand; and even more tricky to lead those teams.</p>

An academic would reach out to the media when he/she has published a new paper. But is there way to forge a deeper relationship and bring academics into the reporting process? What do journalists bring to the table for academics and vice versa?

It makes us treat ideas less preciously! It strengthen our visual muscles! It makes us less sad! And it gets us bridging the gap between words and images!</p>

<p>If we think about headlines as the text’s grounding concept, can we think of our drawings as the visual’s grounding concept? </p>

<ul>
  <li>It could be an illustration, that explores the story’s tone.</li>
  <li>It could be a comic, that tells the story in a scenario</li>

        <div class="session-description"><p>Many newsrooms have recently seen an increase in non-traditional journalists joining as staff. This includes people who help us tell immersive stories online, or do research and reporting using data analysis, mapping, programming or some other skill that might seem like magic to a vast majority of editors. Despite making critical contributions in the reporting and production of the story, they still are not appropriately credited on the story due to wide-ranging issues including newsroom culture/history that subtly manifests that only certain type of reporters can get a byline on a story. Or more mundane issues like the CMS might not allow certain people to get credited or only get credit in a particular way. Since bylines are the most prominent way to get recognized for your work, it also has an impact on what type of person gets further along as their career progresses. </p>

<p>In this session, we will have a broad discussion around the culture of crediting in newsrooms, how it impacts career trajectories, and what are some small and large things we can do to make bylines be more representative of who did the work. </p>

<p>Our goal of the session includes documenting and expanding on a byline guidelines document that the wider digital journalism community can share with their editors and newsrooms. This document would outline why, when and how data/visual/social/non-traditional journalists should get credited on a story.</p>

<p>It sounds like the start of a corny joke, but increasingly we find ourselves in these types of situations - small, interdisciplinary teams working together to solve a problem. The thinking says - throw a lot of really smart people in a room and -magic!- they will figure it out! </p>

<p>The reality is, it does work, but it’s extremely difficult. People misunderstand each other, and motivations and goals are not often articulated, leading to disarray. Working with new people is hard, and it’s especially hard when you have to move fast and you’re not all speaking the same language! But fear not - starting things off on the right foot can have huge payoffs - team buy-in, alignment, and trust. The goal is to get the team to move faster by getting some tough conversations out of the way. </p>

<p>This is an interactive session in which participants will simulate this exact situation - participants will be given a problem prompt, break out into small, cross-disciplinary teams, then participate in kickoff exercises designed to force hard conversations and perhaps give participants a moment of self-reflection - “are you an order or chaos muppet?”, hopes/fears/sacred cows, the road to nirvana, the pre-mortem - and more! </p>

<p>These exercises work best for teams with 5-10 members with any combination of disciplines, but can be scaled up or down as needed.</p>

The platform handles the boring nuts-and-bolts of newsmaking — and we get to do the cool stuff. 
What if designers and developers were more involved in platform-level tooling and software? What does it look like to get over the fear of the complexities of platform and native app architecture, and love it for what it can offer — reusable, scalable tools, and broad exposure to the rest of your newsroom?

Now how would you go about creating a micro community that connect people with similar interests? To facilitate knowledge share, collaboration, problem solving and breeding ground for new ideas.  
Drawing on participants experience will try to identify key challenges as well as strategies to overcome those. I will share my experience with connecting the textAV (textAV.tech) community to kickstart the conversation.</p>

<p>By the end of the session will have 10 takeaways of actionable things you can try out right away.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/hannahsbirch">Hannah Birch</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Working in journalism is a lot like flying an airplane: 
- The stakes are high
- The work matters a lot
- Sometimes the steps are tedious</p>

<p>Sometimes journalists forget stuff. This can lead to things like:
- Mistakes
- Messy, stressful project launches
- Inefficient workflows
- Frustration, tears, questioning whether you should even be flying airplanes (or working in a hospital or doing journalism) in the first place</p>

<p>Just like in aviation, making and using checklists can help avoid mistakes and help you work together better with other people. Checklists can also help standardize processes and make decisions more transparent. Think about things like:
- Writing stories
- Designing layouts
- Launching projects
- Hiring (particularly hiring well)
- Onboarding/offboarding
- Running and following up after meetings
- Enjoying a work life with less frustration/tears</p>

<p>Learn how (and where and when) to use checklists for:
- Yourself and your day-to-day work
- Your team
- Your projects
- Your co-workers
- Your organization</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>In the news nerd community, job responsibilities can be fluid. By definition, we all work close to the blurry line between content producers and technology producers. Sometimes, we are also asked to work close to a similar intersection between individual contributor, people manager, product owner, or some combination thereof. This can mean changes to our day-to-day work lives that raise a lot of questions, including: If I built my professional identity around one type of work, what does it mean that I’m not doing that as much anymore? How do I build the skills I need to succeed now? And, how do I keep my chops if I ever need to go back to what I was doing before?</p>

<p>In this session, we’ll map out together what sort of experiences we’ve had navigating these organizational and career twists, and what answers we’ve all come up with for the questions they raise.</p>

<p>This will not be a debate or an attempt to prove or disprove whether block chain is good or bad for journalism. It’s an earnest call for the people who understand how the same technology underlying a <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/">marketplace for digital cats</a> is going to power a <a href="https://joincivil.com/">distributed</a> journalism to explain it to the rest of us.</p>

<p>In this session, we’ll chat about bad habits that we share and good habits that we would like to build, sort out how to get support from team members, and brainstorm some ideas for fun rewards when we make progress. I’ll help you build out a goal chart (think Bingo) that each member of your team can use to track their own progress.

To answer this question, first we must address your identity—which parts of your identity do you bring with you to work? Which parts do you leave at the door? How does that affect your newsroom experience and how the news is covered in America’s increasingly divisive political and social climate? We’ll begin the session with an exercise that explores our own identities. Different identities impact the work you do and how you interact with others. Then, after hearing from different people in the group, we’ll develop strategies for listening, mentorship, and self-care, using examples from our own experiences at The Seattle Times and The New York Times to explore strategies that we’ve seen work, and how to improve.</p>

<p>By bringing journalists, developers and digital creatives together, we can empower journalists to think about how they want their story to be told. And by creating tools that simplify tasks like creating After Effects assets, short form video or webpages, journalists can get more and more sucked in in the wonderful world of online opportunities.</p>

As more teams are given the freedom to experiment, the need for a practical model to do it with empathy, intention and a willingness to learn is ever greater. </p>

<p>Over two years in the Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab we developed a sustainable process for running experiments by trying methods out until they (mostly) worked for us. In this session,  we’ll talk about the essential building blocks of our process, take it for a test run, and invite others to share methods they’ve used in their newsrooms. </p>

<p>The Mobile Lab’s methodology on its surface is pretty simple: 
* draw a line between an idea and an actual hypothesis
* define success metrics based on all aspects of a user’s experience
* implement precise analytics
* survey your audience about how things went
* have a “burndown” meeting with the entire team to discuss results and insights</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/spetulla">Sam Petulla</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>I’ve been working with Gelman’s Stan group at Columbia University, on ways to visualize Bayesian models. I’d like to talk about this and other projects I’m working on to think through the ways visualizations can be used to present conclusions or hypotheses made from a dataset.</p>

<p>From the simplest poll chart to a movie sales graph to an original simulation that fills in gaps of missing data, when we display a visualization, we are creating for our audience a canvas from which to make inferences. Visualization as a journalistic practice then isn’t just about making a finding pop but weighing all the considerations of our analysis or model, including the survey or research design, when choosing a visual form.</p>

<p>I think we all know this, intuitively, but I think we need to be more specific about some of the considerations for presenting data trends, hypotheses, and regression models. Increasingly, we see “data points heading in one direction” in a two-axis scatter plot as a kind of journalism. But when is it valid?</p>

<p>For this talk, I want to talk about what basic assumptions and considerations journalists should make when using simple regressions and what kinds of red flags statisticians look for in bad model selection or diagnosis. Correlation is not, of course, causation, but a dataset that moves linearly in one direction will be interpreted as demonstrating causation to many readers simply because a trend is there.</p>

<p>There are many other considerations journalists should be making as well: Residuals analysis and heteroskedasticity, p-hacking and overfitting, margin of error and confidence, and overloaded multiple regression models. I’d like to explain how a journalist should be thinking about these questions as opposed to a social scientist or researcher.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I’d like to reframe questions statisticians usually ask in the context of hypothesis testing, prediction or inference as also another context a set of journalistic questions. When we miss collinearity, we’re missing a part of the story that still needs reporting. When we overfit the data, we’re sensationalizing a trend. When we p-hack or shove too many variables into a multiple regression, we’re relying on an unreliable source. When we place our dataset in a scatter plot, if it is shaped in certain ways, it tell us about underlying issues with our data, and we should learn to spot some of those issues, so we can report it out further and decide how to best present it to our audiences.</p>

<p>Those are some things I’m thinking about all the time. I’d like to put them together into a talk that tries to translate some of the best ideas in statistics (I’ll work with statisticians to get it right) into journalistic practices anyone can follow.</p>

<p>I’d also like to find other people in the media who are either building models or thinking a lot about representing findings in data and how audiences make inferences from them that may or may not represent an underlying truth.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/ghongsdusit">Gabriel Hongsdusit</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Comics are an engaging way to present reporting in a visual format. In addition to being more eye-catching than a traditional text story, they can also simplify complex ideas and be adapted to several other mediums, like print, advertisements, etc. This session is a workshop on making a comic based on a narrative. Participants can bring examples of text stories from their newsrooms and see how it can be adapted to a comic or how a comic could be supplementary content to that story. Together we will explore how to break down a narrative into different panels and optimal ways to convey information through the combination of illustration and text.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>Are you a digital native working in news? Are you a reporter looking to get into coding? Are you already a successful synthesis of the two? In this session we discuss the challenges and barriers that might prevent someone from becoming one of the rare hybrids who mixes traditional reporting with coding and digital development, or the difficulties presented to someone already working in that space.</p>

<p>Whether it’s organizational culture, technological challenges, education, lack of time, resources or opportunity or whatever else is standing in your way, we openly share our experiences from both sides of the tracks.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/cheriehu42">Cherie Hu</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>Major media organizations are seeing newfound growth in online subscriptions: The Washington Post’s digital subscriber base more than tripled year-over-year in 2017, while The New York Times’ digital-only subscription revenue increased by 46 percent over the same time period to $340 million. Yet, there are much larger, arguably more scalable media subscription businesses looming overhead: Spotify made $4.6 billion from Premium subscriptions alone in 2017, while Netflix made $11.7 billion and Amazon’s numerous subscription verticals raked in $3.2 billion in the same time period.</p>

<p>One can make a rigorous case that online news sites are now competing directly with these gargantuan media brands for share of users’ time, energy and money. But should music and video streaming services really be the new benchmark for all of media?</p>

<p>Through a series of interactive activities, we’ll dive into what journalists could learn from the Spotify/Netflix/Amazon model about building experiences that foster both participation and loyalty with readers and subscribers—and where that model might fall short for news. We invite participants to bring their own examples of this strategic cross-pollination from their own organizations, which we’ll workshop in small groups with visual, design-oriented exercises (read: many Post-it notes!).</p>

<p>On a higher level, our goal is take a serious, hands-on look at what the phrase “media convergence” really means and whether it’s a truly viable future for the news business, with streaming as our lens.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/tiffehr">Tiff Fehr</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>NYT’s Interactive News team has been working (damned) hard on its hiring practices, including acrobatics like double-blind initial screenings, panel-wide unbiased* assessments of manually anonymized resumes and rigorous, team-consensus evaluation rubric spreadsheets.  It’s ridiculously time-intensive for a few people on the team, but 1,000% worth it.</p>

<p>Like-minded news nerds like Brittany Mayes (NPR) and Sisi Wei (ProPublica) have spoken eloquently about their efforts for internships and fellowships.  SRCCON audiences have been appreciative and very attentive, which means there’s more to pursue on the topic.  Few teams can spare the time, but we have a window available <em>now</em> for getting well ahead of any given news org’s “rebooted” corporate recruiting and hiring efforts.  News nerd teams can cut the trail by adopting hiring practices that truly put our shared ideals front and center, as a demonstration for newsroom and technology groups.</p>

<p>NYT’s Interactive News will soon have four full-time hires worth of investment in refining our revamped hiring practices, which have moved us from unambitious box-ticking to some ridiculously hard debates about terrifyingly talented finalists.  Simultaneously, we are actively building a strong recruiting operation for future open positions.  (And my in-house “expertise” — aka, firm opinions and elaborate spreadsheets — have resulted in me being part of initiatives to shift the NYT’s Technology hiring, too.)  There’s a lot to share in that…with co-presenters I think.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/knowtheory">Ted Han</a></p>
        <div class="session-description"><p>So, your code broke the internet, but nobody’s noticed yet. Not long ago the NPRViz team got a report from one of their users about a pretty serious security flaw in Pym.js, and so suddenly found themselves with the challenge of figuring out how to notify Pym users they needed to upgrade immediately without just blasting out to the world that it was possible to steal their users session data &amp; cookies.  I (and others) ended up helping them walk through the security disclosure process, helped draft messages intended to encourage users to upgrade, and poked people in the community.  There are individual things that folks who produce software for others can do to make this process easier for themselves &amp; users, but also there are things that we should be doing as users to make sure we’re prepared to upgrade when flaws are announced, and also, how to lend a hand when things are going wrong.  Lets talk about what <em>more</em> we can and should be doing.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>If you are a news nerd, you probably know how to make data graphics in just a few lines of code, whether in d3, R, or python. But computer tools can restrict your creativity by making you think inside the box, both figuratively and literally. </p>

<p>In this session, we’ll bust out the markers, paper, stickers, string, balloons, and other fun stuff. We’ll practice iterating on ideas, freed from the computer. Inspired by the work of Mona Chalabi (who uses hand-drawn visualizations to make her work more accessible), Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi (who embarked on a year-long personal data collection postcard project which became the book Dear Data), and Jose Duarte (of Handmade Visuals), we will play with color, shape, size, and texture. </p>

<p>I’ll provide some supplies, but you’re welcome to bring your own! Do you have a pack of Prismacolor markers burning a hole in your pocket? A washi tape collection that never sees the light of day? We can visualize data with that!</p>

Rethinking how we engage with communities that need trustworthy news? Producing interactive stories in formats your editor couldn’t even envision a year ago? You’re a change agent, and so are we. So let’s get together and chat. </p>

<p>With the journalism industry in a state of constant flux these days, there are many of us working to improve processes within our newsrooms, foster collaboration between departments, engage new audiences and find revenue solutions that will actually work. This session will provide an opportunity for those of us pushing for change inside and outside of the newsroom to come together to discuss what’s worked, what hasn’t, and what challenges we continue to face. </p>

<p>We want people to be excited about making change within their organizations, whether it’s a small workflow change or a big cultural change.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>A “words” journalist can spend their entire career as a reporter, starting with daily general assignment reporting and moving to beat reporting, international reporting, or investigative reporting. Along the way, they increase their visibility, credibility, and earnings. What could that look like for the journalism-tech community? For example, a “news nerd” version of a traditional foreign correspondent could uncover datasets abroad, figure out ways to engage the local community, or deploy hardware sensors to track environmental conditions.</p>

<p>We’ll first talk about all the different kinds of skills we bring to newsrooms. Then we’ll spend some time interviewing each other before we create out-of-the-box job descriptions we can get excited about.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>As digital journalists, we often push the platform forward, with cool new interactives and high-impact layouts. Unfortunately, accessibility is often ignored in the process. It’s easy to make excuses: we’re on deadline, or visual content wouldn’t work in a screen reader anyway. But what if it’s far easier than you think? In this session, we’ll set up accessibility tools, share lessons we’ve learned about creating inclusive pages, and assemble a list of easy wins that you can take back to your newsrooms and digital teams.</p>

        <div class="session-description"><p>The key to creating a culture of learning is radical empathy, yet that’s not always easy. For one, the people likely doing tech-type training at your organization may be highly skilled themselves, and at a technical level that others may not think they can reach or may not want to reach. How do you avoid that? How do you help reporters build out the time in their schedules for learning and convince them that this is part of their daily jobs? How do you make sure that learning reaches beginners and experts equally and that you’re meeting people where they are? NYT has been grappling with these questions. We’d love to talk about what other organizations have done to encourage learning, how everyone can participate and what strategies are effective. We’ll gather in small groups to brainstorm around specific problems and come away with solutions for every sized newsroom.</p>
