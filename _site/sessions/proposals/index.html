        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/gerald_arthur">Gerald Rich</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jue_yang">Jue Yang</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Interested in using maps to identify food deserts, compare neighborhood distances to voting polls, or calculate the population within a flood zone? Are you guilty of creating overlapping geographic layers to show correlations?

While many newsrooms use maps to visualize geographic information — everything from election results to wildfires — a few simple techniques can make those maps more informed and insightful.

We’ll show you how to interview geographic data using network analysis and discuss a few common concepts (buffers, spatial joins, distances, etc). We’ll talk about how specific stories have analyzed geodata using a combination of free tools such as QGIS, turf.js, and leaflet.js. Afterward, we’ll open the floor for you to share your own experiences and questions. If you have your own favorite techniques or tools, give them a shout out!

This session is for beginner and intermediate data journalists who have used maps in their reporting, or for anyone who wants to go beyond simple geographic visualizations.</p>

        <p class="session-description">We all know the audience should be at the centre of our thinking when commissioning and creating news apps. But what are the actual processes different newsrooms follow to make sure they are? What questions do they ask? What exercises do they conduct? How do they talk about users and their needs? I would conduct a survey of news apps teams ahead of SRCCON, provide that information to attendees and then facilitate a discussion.</p>

        <p class="session-description">So you've got a cool tool, and it's starting to take off. The kids - they love it! The old folks - they love it too! Now the question is: How can you build an organization that can sustain your cool tool - and the community behind it? Where will the money come from? What are your options?</p>

        <p class="session-description">What's MySQL hiding? Is PostgreSQL ready to lead your news app? Just how is SQLServer using your precious resources? Just because your SQL is similar across platforms doesn't mean they work the same under the hood. We'll look deep inside and see how different database platforms work at a granular level, and we'll also show hilarious negative ads about databases.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/mikejcorey">Michael Corey</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Engaging with scientific research gives you access to powerful data and sources with deep, expert knowledge on your topic. But even when you walk through the door with widespread scientific consensus on your side, getting sources to engage with that reality, especially outside their core expertise, can be difficult. Very smart people are perfectly capable of epic denial and rationalization. It's not just climate change, and it's not just red states. Earthquakes in Oklahoma, catastrophic drought in California, take your pick. When a professor of structural engineering tells you earthquake predictions are "just speculation," what's the best way to push the conversation forward?</p>

        <h2 class="session-title"><a href="#proposal-116337">Data Audioization: How Do We Bring Numbers To Life With Sound? <span class="permalink">&para;</span></a></h2>
        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanwb">Jordan Wirfs-Brock</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">As we design data stories, most of us naturally lean toward visualization and graphic representation. But it doesn’t have to be this way: Take Radiolab’s use of a chorus to demonstrate the color vision of mantis shrimp, or the New York Time’s use of tonal blips to show the difference in finishing time between Olympic medalists. (Find these examples and more at http://listentodata.tumblr.com/.) Audio is a rich, intimate medium that can convey some ideas - like the passage of time - better than graphics and allows you to layer information in sophisticated ways.

In this hands on session, I challenge you to think outside the data visualization box and tell a data story using sound as the primary medium. In small groups, we’ll prototype data audioizations using real datasets. We’ll also brainstorm what tools, technologies, software and best practices newsrooms can use to incorporate data audioization into their work.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/mattliddy">Matthew Liddy</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">In a typical Scrum workflow, once you lock in the tasks for a given sprint period, they do not change. This is challenging in a news environment where breaking stories and "urgent" requests pop up regularly. How do teams tackle this challenge? (Or don't they?)</p>

        <p class="session-description">"I sort of see data journalism ... as social science done on deadline." -- Steve Doig

You know who's great at doing social science? Social scientists. This session explores how journalists can work with academics to inform the public in new ways. It would examine some extremely powerful - and popular - examples of the stories hacks, hackers and (ahem) hackademics can tell when they work together effectively, as well as some examples where things have not quite gone to plan.

Participants could discuss their own experiences, especially what challenges they have faced, and how they overcame them.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/hamman">Brian Hamman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kleinmatic">Scott Klein</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">It's been 10 years since chicagocrime.org won a Batten award for innovation in journalism. In that decade hackers have joined the ranks of newsrooms large and small, and then left newsrooms to join startups and non-profits (If they Left newsrooms is that good or bad?). We now have many tribes of news nerds, journo-hackers, data wranglers and user experience researchers. Let's take a step back and see how large our community has grown. Who are we? What jobs do we have? How are our teams built? What problems are we trying to solve? What are the ingredients of a successful team?

We plan to do a survey leading up to SRCCON  to take stock of anyone who identifies with the DATA-journo-tech-design community. We'll present the results at SRCCON and then lead a discussion about what we found: Are we missing some key members of our community? Are we tackling the right problems? Are we learning the right skills and reaching out to the right people? How do we help news organizations create and sustain great teams?

We don't know, but it's been a decade since our little community got started. Let's find out who we are.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/knowtheory">Ted Han</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">User-centric design doesn't end at the browser GUI.  How we build our tools for our own use and for others' as well as ease of contribution are vitally important when onboarding new team members or open sourcing tools for others to use.  We can talk about examples that are run in our space (like DocumentCloud) and talk w/ goals you have for your own tools.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/@mkramer">Melody Joy Kramer</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">I will lead a guided workshop on how to design better READMEs, newcomers guides, and GitHub issues to welcome new contributors (and non-coders) to open source projects.

Participants will leave with concrete steps to make their hackathons and open source projects more accessible and inclusive. (Oh yes, and this will also involve a game of Hot Potato.)</p>

        <p class="session-description">The pace of change demands that journo-coders constantly learn and build their expertise.  Paired coding is a valuable model for learning together and sharing insights.  How might adopting this model add to the types of training offerings currently available and address larger topics like change management, impact and audience development? What is currently missing from opportunities and resources?  Can we build them?  Let’s have a conversation about paired coding as a model for learning and developing expertise.  Participants will leave this session with a better understanding of paired programming and concrete ideas for how to incorporate it into their self-directing learning.   We will start with a group discussion of pair programming, including illustrative examples and then work in small groups to identify potential strategies and ideas to incorporate pair programming into your own work and your team.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/gboone42">Greg Boone</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tanedanger">Tane Danger</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">This is a proposal to blend improv theater with a short hackathon during a hands-on workshop. We'll begin with a brief introduction to a timely, local public policy issue. Then, before beginning we'll lead a brief improv workshop and introduce some prepared resources to help participants successfully build prototype a web app to address the policy issue during the session.

The session would end with a performance by the cast of The Theater of Public Policy. They would use all the things discussed during the session, and of course the various prototypes created by each group, as inspiration for unscripted comedy theater.</p>

        <p class="session-description">What do voice-recognition assistants, Slack bots and the latest crop of mobile payment apps have in common? They all use natural language messaging as the interface — an area journalists have largely ignored over the past decade. It’s time for a closer look.

In this session, we’ll explore the rich, hidden history of using messaging as the medium for fun, quirky, and occasionally powerful applications, ranging from SmarterChild and Siri to SnapCash and Wolfram Alpha. What can newsrooms learn about interacting with their audience in this intimate format? Can we design a more personal way to tell stories through messaging or develop new messaging products to serve our audience?</p>

        <p class="session-description">We all work with people who are not like us: people with different job descriptions, vocabulary, priorities, skills, and assumptions. These differences are valuable, even essential, to creating good and beautiful things, but damnit we need to be able to communicate effectively. We need to be as diligent and thoughtful in our conversations as we are in other aspects of our work. In this session we want to crowdsource strategies and best practices for when, where and how we communicate with our coworkers.</p>

        <p class="session-description">You were the only developer or designer in the newsroom. You have a workflow and framework that works perfectly for you. Everything is in control. Now you have a second person on the team. Not only can the other person help you with daily deadlines, but you need to develop a framework and a workflow that makes it easy for both of you to collaborate and will give this team the potential to grow. This is a challenge, but also an opportunity. 

Here's what we want to talk about: What decisions are there to make? What should we take into consideration? Static vs. dynamic news apps? Ruby, Python or Javascript? Live in the CMS or create stand alone pages? What open source tools work best for us? What are we missing here? 

There isn’t a single right answer to these questions. The challenge is how to make decisions.  We feel this could be an opportunity not only for small teams to learn best practices, but also for bigger teams to rethink their model and share their experiences. We will produce a document to collect ideas. It will be a resource for newsrooms, walking people through the decision-making process to find the best approach. We also expect to update this after the conference as the conversation evolves.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Are we developers, designers, reporters or news nerds? Is what we make an app, graphic or story? Or is it a visualization, interactive or “thing?” Is what we do incredibly complex or ineffably easy? Or is it somehow both? When does which word work?

How we talk about what we do, how everyone else talks about it, and how those conceptual underpinnings become manifest, has a direct effect on on our growing field. It shapes who we can recruit, what we’re permitted to do and how our work is valued.

We don’t have answers to any of this, which is why we want to hear from people established in the field, those just starting out and everybody in between. Outside perspectives are also welcome.

We’ll share our experiences with perceptions shaped by language choice and we’ll ask others for theirs. Attendees will sketch out preliminary definitions for some of these terms, then will discuss what works and when. We don’t expect to walk out with a perfect blueprint or final answers — cultural change takes more than one conversation — but we hope to advance our collective thinking and leave slightly more confident in how we describe ourselves.</p>

        <p class="session-description">At DataMade, we’ve been building robots like dedupe and parserator to do the laborious and boring work of extracting, cleaning, and linking data. These tools are great for structured tabular files, but much of the valuable data we need are still locked away in paper documents. Let’s talk about extracting structured information from these messy paper forms.

Over the past five years, the open source computer vision library OpenCV has become very powerful, and through wrappers, great documentation, and tutorials, it has also become accessible to mere mortals (well, you still need to know how to program). 

While there have already been applications of computer vision techniques in the newsroom --image and map stitching (schooner-tk) and table extraction from PDFs (Tabula) --the opportunities remain largely unexplored. 

In this hands-on session, we’ll review OpenCV techniques applied to the terrifying problem of extracting data from HANDWRITTEN, SCANNED, PAPER FORMS.

All code examples  will be in Python.</p>

        <p class="session-description">"Robot journalism" has gotten a lot of buzz over the last couple of years, mainly in the context of big-name newsrooms in big, coastal cities (e.g., The Associated Press, The Los Angeles Times), sometimes automating thousands of stories a quarter. That's neat, but how relevant is it to everyone else? How can smaller newsrooms get a piece of the action?

        <p class="session-description">We all work hard and on deadlines in our jobs and each one of us tries its best to have some tools, tricks and secret recipes to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.

I think this conference will be a great time to share that knowledge with other colleagues, whether that is a text editor plugin to visualize markdown on the fly while typing it, a browser extension to test REST services, command line sugar that make your life easier or keyboard shortcuts that speed up your workflow...let's collaboratively create a collection of best practices to ease up our work.

        <p class="session-description">Journalism needs more tech-literate leaders: people who can teach, evangelize, and motivate newsrooms to adapt and experiment. But when you’re not in senior management (and sometimes even when you are), how can you wield any influence? How can we claim decision-making power, or build relationships with those who have it?
  
We’ve heard a lot of people worry that nothing will change until organizational leadership changes. Maybe that’s true — but maybe it’s also time to think about leadership differently. Newsroom leaders come in many forms, and there’s so much we can do regardless of our positions and titles. Let’s sit in a room together and talk about how we can change our organizations for the better and support each other as we do it.</p>

        <p class="session-description">The pristine processes we create stay that way only as long as it takes for humans to start using them. Inevitably, the messiness of life creeps in — someone procrastinates, your kid was up all night with a fever, mental health struggles make work untenable for a team member. Knowing that the humans we work with are more important than a rigid system and schedule, how might we build empathy into our workflows? How can we plan for the mess and create margins for it in a way that allows us to work both effectively and happily? 

During this session, we’ll talk through ways to manage delays and crises, big and small. Participants will leave with practical ideas to make processes adaptable to real life.</p>

We'll talk about how you find what's right for you from technology to content and really huge to just right.

        <p class="session-description">How do we find and scale leadership networks for journalism and technology, particularly in the global context?  As news organizations expand their footprints and their partnerships overseas, and as increasing numbers of newsroom workers (not just correspondents!) seek international opportunities, the communities we  tap into will make or break our success. This discussion draws on the experiences of Hacks/Hackers chapter organizers around the world to highlight some of the challenges and best strategies for creating and accessing collaborative news-tech communities across different social, political and economic environments.

In this guided discussion, we'll talk about how to scale leadership across informal and grassroots groups, how to find and engage effective partners, and the right metrics for measuring the effectiveness of events and the participation of members. By brainstorming challenges faced by specific chapters, we'll gain insight into how the environment for journalism and technology changes drastically in different countries. We'll also create better frameworks for approaching challenges like transfers of leadership, differences in cultural expectations and ways to define value for members.</p>

        <p class="session-description">How can we build good products if our energy is spent tearing each other down? We all know that we value a “good team culture,” but we’re often vague about what that means or how to achieve it. But what if it’s as easy as setting out your team practices as a checklist, the same way you would for any other project? For instance, making sure that individual interactions between team members — even arguments — are approached in an “actively positive” manner? Or ensuring that every team member agrees and understands the grounds on which a proposed feature is judged?  Thinking about “culture,” precisely and vigorously, comes in especially handy when your team needs to onboard junior members, or when there’s a on-the job learning happening (which is, let’s admit it, all the freaking time). 

Using techniques and advice from an industry that is all about making communication and relationships healthier, we’ll work together in this interactive workshop to create better frameworks for how we give and receive feedback. Participants will leave with actionable strategies for how to make space for criticism on their teams, how to wrangle all the egos, and simple ways we can encourage and support each other as we build things every day.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Attending conferences with a like-minded community is inspiring, motivating and affirming. We go home full of ideas and energy and hope. Then our day-to-day life creeps back in and it gets hard to move those new ideas forward, becomes tricky to make space for learning the new skills we want, and we can feel isolated from the community we build here. If you can’t attend a conference at all, you can feel all of the above times two. 

After the conferences, how do we keep that inspiration and how do we stay accountable? For those who don’t have access to conferences or events, how can we make our community — and the inspiration we share — accessible all of the time? What are the obstacles that prevent us from making things happen? How might we build each other and our community up in the day to day, the quiet interludes between the big tent revivals?

During this session we’ll work together to identify major obstacles that prevent follow through, and small groups will brainstorm ways to address those obstacles. We’ll leave with a clear sense of how we can collaborate with, contribute to and build our community outside of a conference bubble.</p>

We’ll share our experiences and talk about strategies for making the difficult calls -- usually, “to build or not to build?” -- that small teams inevitably face, as well as about how to make responsible, forward-looking choices regarding where to focus your code resources.

        <p class="session-description">Design's user-centric orientation places the needs and expectations of users at the center of the designer's decision-making process. Journalism’s objectivity ethos has journalists striving to report on facts (and not their personal attitude toward facts), with fairness and accuracy. 

With newsrooms embracing new skill sets and welcoming more collaboration between people with a variety of professional backgrounds, different practices and traditions collide. Where is the line between designing for an audience and pandering to that audience? 

In this session we explore user-centered design’s fit in the newsroom and the processes of reporting, and how characterizing the audience for a story shapes decisions about what, how when and where a story is told.</p>

        <p class="session-description">No matter how useful a piece of open source software is, documentation is often the difference between whether it flourishes or dies a quiet death. But writing the docs is still an afterthought for a lot of developers, something to check off a list at the last minute before moving on. The end result is a lot of wasted potential, great tools that put off potential users because nobody can figure out how they work.

In this session, we'll discuss patterns of effective documentation and our own experiences as both readers and writers. How do we balance readability and precision? How do we write docs that serve both beginners and experts? How do we choose good examples? How do we make writing the docs a first-class citizen of any project, something that feels integral and not like extra homework? When we're reading docs, what makes things click and what makes us give up? Finally, we'll split up into groups and break out the red pens for close readings of documentation from a selection of popular libraries, and maybe even make some pull requests with our edits.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryJo Webster">MaryJo Webster</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CJSinner">C.J. Sinner</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">The workflow system of getting text (i.e. stories), photos and static graphics into the printed editions of newspapers has evolved over literally 100+ years and it is now a very, very refined process in every newsroom we’ve been in. Putting those same items on digital has essentially just been tagged onto the end of that process. But in many newsrooms this workflow doesn't work well for digital-only work, particularly when it involves data. 

We’d like this session to be a work-group format with a goal to create the ideal workflow -- from idea germination to publication. This should include best practices for communication flows, deadlines, how/when items will be edited (for usability, clarity, style, grammar, spelling, etc), process for creating/sharing/discussing mockups, first drafts, etc. A very key piece should be who should be included in the process and when (and by “who” we want to identify skillsets, rather than specific job titles). Some of the questions that could be used as part of this discussion include: How and when should people (i.e. reporter, data wranglers, devs, editors, copy editors) get looped in? What are realistic time frames for getting a digital-only project completed (obviously dependant on the scope)? How should deadlines be used in this workflow? What skillsets are needed (this goes back to the “who” is involved piece) to ensure you’re producing high-quality digital product? 

We’d like to split into three groups, each working on their own proposed workflows to address three different scenarios: 1) a digital product that accompanies an enterprise story that is weeks or months in the making, 2) a digital product that needs to be done quickly (either daily or short-term), either with or without a story
and 3) a stand-alone digital-only product, such as a news app or tool which does not heavily feature a text component.

We realize many people attending the session come from organizations where there are a lot of road bumps that might need to be fixed before such a system could be put into place, but we don’t want to spend this session just talking about the problems. At the end of the session, we’ll combine the three groups to discuss the implementation piece. Who has had success? What worked, what didn't? How do you convince higher-ups that this should be a priority? How do you cut through the office politics?

We want to come up with an ideal workflow that can be used by newsrooms as a goal to achieve, since each newsroom will likely have its own unique problems to resolve before achieving it.</p>

What is the equivalent for learning &amp; practicing journalism?
If you could create a news organization focused on teaching newcomers to the field with volunteer chapters across the country, what would that look like? What are the financial, editorial, educational, and organizational considerations? Anyone can start a local news blog, but what kind of infrastructure and education would best sustain these efforts? How might a distributed news organization be created using the community-building practices and tools of open source software?

        <p class="session-description">Many good ideas come out of journalists who are enthusiastic about their beats and the opportunity to capture large audiences. But there are lots of them, and only one or two of us. So how do you say no to good ideas, while keeping those good ideas flowing? How do you tell senior editors that you don’t have the resources when they want Snowfall? How do you determine which of the good ideas has the most value journalistically, and/or most potential for audience, social sharing or revenue? Doing this poorly leads to missed opportunities, time wasted on projects with no legs or shelf life, journalistic flaws, poor execution because of overbooking your time or unrealistic expectations — and burnout from long hours, nights and weekends. Doing it well strengthens our journalism, builds audience and reputation, opens new revenue opportunities and leads to even more good ideas.

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/dancow">Daniel Nguyen</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Programming creates so many technical and creative inventions that it's natural for aspiring programmers to dream of big projects in the cloud. But this ambition ignores the actual goal of programming, which is almost completely about making machines do mundane work. And it is counterproductive to learning how to program, which requires consistent practice as in every other form of literacy and art. 
 
So this session will be about mundane programming. Programming not to be the next Zuckerberg, or to get a better job 3 months from now, but to make today or just the next ten minutes more enjoyable. Instead of focusing specifically on how to code, we'll expand upon the reasons of why we code (though seeing is often believing when it comes to code, so feel free to bring both ideas and Gists). And we'll trim the personal prerequisites of programming, which don't include being an entrepreneur, having a profitable idea, building a website, contributing to open source, or changing the world or your career. Programming can be learned, and done, with a willingness to learn and a wide variety of small problems to practice upon.</p>

        <p class="session-description">We gave a couple people in our newsroom training in Adobe Illustrator and our graphics style guide and set them loose to make their own graphics. Let's talk about how terrifying that is and what there is to keep them making great work with the new skills.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Is journalism dying to our short attention spans? Love it or hate it, many people get their news by social media. Overview of social media campaign tracking metric tools. And the million dollar question, how does that support existing business models or make money on it's own.</p>

        <h2 class="session-title"><a href="#proposal-105889">Kite mapping for fun and profit! <span class="permalink">&para;</span></a></h2>
        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/hyper_linda">Linda Sandvik</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Like the outdoors? Aerial photography? Documenting illegal deforestation in central America or mapping relief efforts after a natural disaster? Maybe kite mapping is for you. Sure, all the cool kids are using drones. But when journalists get arrested for trespassing when they are using their shiny + easy to spot drone to film correctional facilities, their colleague flying a kite is less likely to be stopped (what, I'm just flying my kite?). Let's make a kite and go for a walk around a Minneapolis lake or two. (Note: this requires some wind. But fear not, if there is no wind the backup plan is to do (helium) ballon mapping instead. Still cheaper than a drone). After kite-flying we'll have a look at the photos, stitch them together, contribute it Open Street Map and talk about some cool kite mapping projects.

(this workshop will work over two days, day 1 mapping (a couple of hours), day 2 do some stuff with computers)</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewwatson">Andy Watson</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Protecting yourself and your important information safe when reporting on stories either overseas in dangerous areas or when the subject of your reporting is a dangerous criminal gang can be intimidating.  It's something Brian Krebs has written about a number of times and it made me wonder if reporters and sources are fully prepared to face challenges like trumped up charges based on forged evidence given to police, financial fraud etc...

In this session, I'd like to discuss methods for protecting yourself and your family both at home and abroad.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/dataeditor">Steven Rich</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Machine learning is suddenly the new, hip thing in data journalism. But like every tool in a toolbox, it has some uses but is not a go-to tool in every situation. This session will look at how some journalists have used machine learning and in what situations it's best and in what situations it should be avoided.</p>
