        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/sandhya__k">Sandhya Kambhampati</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">We talk a lot about documenting our work throughout projects, but we really don't talk enough about how we can use better documentation to start us off in our jobs with the right knowledge and technology stack of the newsroom. For example, when someone leaves the newsroom is there some type of minimum documentation that they have to do or is there no expectation set for this? What about all of the institutional knowledge that people take when they leave a newsroom? Should there be guidelines on what sources and information you leave behind so the next person doesn't have to spend a lot of time reinventing the wheel? 
Let's have a discussion about newsroom on-boarding and off-boarding processes and how we, as a news nerd community, can work through some simple ways together to make these processes more efficient and useful for the future.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/@mshelton">Martin Shelton</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">How do we encourage better security hygiene in the newsroom? As news organizations conduct research and connect with sources, we may not always understand how our data can be "leaked" through both legal and technical means. In this guided conversation, we examine the challenges for controlling our information, how to protect ourselves, and the limitations of contemporary security software. Through this discussion, we can identify challenges demanding further development as well as effective techniques to empower journalists and developers to secure the newsroom.</p>

        <p class="session-description">How can we make sure that our data stories are being held to a high standard? It can be hard to fight the temptation to draw sweeping conclusions with bad data, but perhaps there are ways to put checks and balances in place to make sure that our analysis is accurate. Let's discuss peer review processes and things that have worked in newsrooms and methods that have proved ineffective. Is there a best-practices approach to holding ourselves accountable for the data stories we tell?</p>

        <p class="session-description">Your newsroom finally gets it -- graphics and visuals and internet things are awesome. So now they want a nerd team. And they've put you in charge. Shit.

Nobody in your newsroom can coach you on how to hire a designer or mentor a developer or manage a software project. So you're making it up as you go. Well, that's what the rest of us did too. But it'd be a damn shame if we all kept making the same mistakes.

Let's talk.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/emgollie">Emily Goligoski</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">“A new form of journalism.” That’s what George Gallup said that asking people about their preferences equates to—and that was back in the 1930s (“Politics and the New Machine,” The New Yorker, November 16, 2015). The goal of listening to audiences isn’t a new one and is highly valuable for producing powerful news presentations. Yet many media organizations aren’t utilizing user research today because of lack of funds, recording equipment, physical space and/or expert guidance. In lacking easy ways to gain insights into people's busy lives, news teams can become overly dependent on their own instincts. This results in unimaginative story presentations and tired templates that fail to engage existing and would­-be audiences.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Let’s discuss and sketch what a user research toolkit for distributed news teams might look like. What combination of methods for listening and observation (including but not limited to interviews, surveys, usability testing and co-­design techniques) would help your own team’s efforts? How can we best enable people working across functions to run their own audience research? What would it take for newsrooms to adopt a more flexible take on the traditional usability lab? This session will involve a lot of creativity as well as real talk about organizational change and costs considerations. Come join as we democratize user experience research access to make improvements for reader, viewer and listener benefit.</p>

        <h2 class="session-title"><a href="#proposal-316229">Let’s work together to hack diversity into our organizations <span class="permalink">&para;</span></a></h2>
        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by Erin Grau and <a href="https://twitter.com/hamman">Brian Hamman</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">We all know that it's important to have more diversity in tech, but there has been frustrating little progress on this front. It can be demoralizing when senior executives don't prioritize diversity as an issue and the task of changing the culture at a company can feel overwhelming. These challenges are especially acute at companies that have not historically considered themselves tech companies, because the senior leadership is often not as aware of the barriers and biases against women in technical roles.

As we continue to expand the technology group at The New York Times, we are actively invested in diversity and inclusion. We firmly believe that our workforce should reflect our audience, which is global and diverse. Diversity drives growth and innovation, and a diverse workforce allows us to best serve our readers by speaking authentically about more experiences.

We are organizing this session to brainstorm and discuss on-the-ground techniques to support the hiring, retention and advancement of diverse talent in technology, with a focus on how to effect change at large organization outside of Silicon Valley. This talk will introduce some of the obstacles commonly seen in diversity efforts and allow for a discussion around solutions to the most common pitfalls.</p>

        <h2 class="session-title"><a href="#proposal-315916">Better Metaphors For Technical Debt <span class="permalink">&para;</span></a></h2>
        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/risatrix">Amanda Krauss</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Do you, or anyone you know, feel personally victimized by tech debt? If you work for any sort of digital organization, the answer is probably yes. If you’re on the tech side, you feel frustrated when you try to tell non-coders and business folks why it’s a priority. If you’re not on the tech side, you feel frustrated at hearing the phrase “tech debt” repeated over and over, without any apparent connection to your department’s priorities.

If we take a step back, we might find that debt isn't right metaphor for what we’re talking about. What we call "tech debt" is incurred not by individual debtors, but by organization-wide processes (or lack thereof). And unlike monetary debt, most tech debt can’t be paid off quickly, even if you have financial resources to throw at it. We need better ways to describe what tech debt is, how it builds up, and how to fix it, in terms that the whole company can understand.

In this session, I’ll talk about metaphors (such as home renovation) that have helped our newsroom unite in our success over considerable tech debt, and invite participants to share their own experiences of explaining or hearing about technical debt. By creating a campaign to explain tech debt effectively, participants will leave equipped to get organizational buy-in by making communication the first step of your technical debt plan.</p>

        <h2 class="session-title"><a href="#proposal-315684">How do we convey technical ideas without dumbing things down? <span class="permalink">&para;</span></a></h2>
        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/bo_p">Bo Peng</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">As a data science consultant, I use methods from statistics, machine learning, and design to solve problems. Communicating our findings effectively is to key to our success; it’s important to both 1) faithfully and accurately present the data, the findings, and our recommendations, while 2) presenting all of that information in a quick, easily digestible way. Often, our end users don’t have the time or technical expertise to comprehensively study our entire method, but neither do they ever want to blindly trust a “black box” method. So where is the in-between? 

I'll start the discussion by going through some of our experiences in communicating data science ideas both honestly and intuitively: from data visualization design choices, to experiential learning as a means for clients to understand complex ideas, to presentations with our end-to-end approach illustrated in simple analogies. 

Then I'd like to open up the floor,  and learn from everybody else's experience. Time willing, I'd like to provide the opportunity for people to take a stab at presenting technical ideas of their own, and present them to the group in an intuitive way.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Sometimes the best solution for a problem isn't very user friendly, whether it be command line tools, graphics software, or pretty much any GIS system.

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/anieldaniel">Annie Daniel</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Let’s talk about our internship programs from both sides of the fence.
Internships are weird. For interns, they’re faced with crippling imposter syndrome on top of whatever college obligations they have, plus the quest for a job. They see listings mention things like D3, Angular and Django and freeze with uncertainty. Most students are lucky if they’ve had a class mention even one of those things. This internship could mean a shining opportunity, or it could mean realizing that they’re a heap of useless and don’t know anything. No pressure.
For mentors, they have jobs and projects and deadlines and bosses. They’re doing their best to keep up with editorial demands while staying current with the latest libraries and design trends. Then, every summer a heap of applications arrive on your desk, and they all look and sound the same. Eventually, the interns arrive and need to be on-boarded (not only with the org’s CMS, but also with the team’s development environment), brought up to speed on stories and ongoing projects, and given assignments all within a few days. Plus if they screw up, it’s on you.
How can we improve our internship programs and make it a little easier on both sides? How can we increase diversity and be more realistic with our technical expectations? Let’s talk about how to make this better from application to potential hires.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by Neil Wargo</p>
        <p class="session-description">A redesign is a seemingly ever-looming cloud over any publication's web presence, a matter of when, not if. Whether it’s a simple personal blog or the web’s most trafficked sites, the underlying motivations and strategies are often the same. The goal of this group discussion is to dissect the culture surrounding the redesign to learn from one another what makes for a successful redesign, from the initial planning process to the post-mortem, with a focus on the following topics:

- Motivations and factors contributing to the decision to redesign
- Organizational and project management approaches to the discovery, design and development process
- Finding the appropriate balance of risk, innovation and user familiarity
- Surprises discovered, either along the way or after launching
- Interacting with users and accepting user feedback
- Assessing the successes and failures of a redesign after launching

        <p class="session-description">At the end of 2014, Eric Meyer opened his Facebook feed to see an automated post marked "your year in review," with a picture of his daughter--who had died that year from a brain tumor--surrounded by clip art of partygoers, confetti, and balloons. Nobody meant to cause Meyer harm, but thoughtlessness in the design of the feature (what he termed "inadvertent algorithmic cruelty") still left him shaken. And countless other examples abound.

Of course, in the news industry, we're no strangers to accidental (and disastrous) juxtaposition: real estate ads placed next to stories on homelessness, bots that generate cringe-worthy content, and scheduled social media posts that go out during the worst kind of breaking news. In this session, we'll look at case studies of humane and inhumane design, practice identifying pitfalls in our news apps, and figure out how to care for our readers beyond just transmitting information.</p>

        <p class="session-description">*Or, how we broke the Internet to reinvent it.

Steward Brand famously said that, "On the one hand information wants to be expensive, because it's so valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time." 

Publishers are continually looking for new angles to release content. It moved from the desktop, to mobile, and now from the browser into apps. App publishers require even more control, in the last year, we have seen the proliferation of publishing change hands from just HTML/CSS/JS to Google's AMP project, Facebook Instant Articles, and Apple News. Markup has been replaced with data models, and the browser wars have evolved into social network insights.</p>
