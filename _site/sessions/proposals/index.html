        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/allanlasser">Allan Lasser</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">People expect websites to be useful, while machines expect websites to be readable. We must carefully negotiate the form and the function of our web interfaces. Progressive enhancement is a key concept, but how do we apply it? And when is it okay to break the rules and *gasp* require JavaScript? I'd like to use this session to look closer at the compromises we make between wide accessability and rich interaction. It will consider how we practice the design, implementation, and preservation of web pages, as well as how we utilize old technologies and new techniques.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/tylermachado">Tyler Machado</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">We news nerds can be a solitary bunch, whether we’re solo newsroom coders, part of a small-resources organization or on a distributed team. But even when working solo, management is important -- maybe even moreso! What tools and techniques do you use to work alone efficiently? How do you ensure you're not going way off-track if you don't have a proper editor? How do you communicate/collaborate with colleagues, especially if they don’t share your jargon? What’s your strategy for training and leveling-up your skills? Let’s share what has and hasn’t worked.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Sometimes, the thing a beginner needs to grasp a concept is a simple analog. For instance, I taught a class in data visualization and one of the early classes was using LEGO to visualize data. There are all sorts of code concepts and data concepts that students -- from university courses to workshops -- struggle to grasp. What if we came up with a list of goofy, hands on ways to teach concepts that others could steal. How could you teach loops by making people run around a room? Or filtering? Or basic algorithms? Or visualization concepts? By making new concepts memorable for beginners, we stand a much better chance of spreading knowledge. Come throw out your ideas.</p>

        <p class="session-description">The techniques driving big newsrooms have applications beyond journalism. As niche publications struggle to keep up there's a potential future where journalists and the techniques they practice have a vital place in other industries, especially niches; helping to spread knowledge, ask or answer vital questions,  and generally drive the pace of innovation through discovery.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Election night. Super Bowl. Oscars. Apple Event. High-profile, high-traffic events are a part of every news organization. How do you prepare your sites and applications for this event? How do you write performant code that scales? What cache setup makes the most sense for your event? What mobile or application dependencies should you be on the lookout for? How do you prepare your team? And, if something goes wrong, how should you handle communication and resolution? In this session we'll walk through some real-life scenarios and simulate emergency situations for folks to share their thoughts and experiences. Participants should walk out of this session with a checklist of items that they can use to prepare for the next high traffic event they have, to ensure that on their most high-profile day of the year, their sites and apps are up and running.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/brianabelson">Brian Abelson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mhkeller">Michael Keller</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">How newsrooms conceive of and measure the impact of their work is a messy, idiosyncratic, and often rigorous process. Based at times on what simply seems worth remembering during the life of a story or, at others, on strict guidelines of what passes the "impact bar." Over the past two years, we conceived of and constructed NewsLynx (http://newslynx.org) to address two needs: first, as an attempt to understand how and through what processes news organizations large and small are currently approaching the "impact problem" and second, if we could develop a better way — through building an open-source platform— to help those newsrooms capture the qualitative and quantitive impact of their work.

Coming two weeks after the official public release of NewsLynx, this session will serve as the first opportunity for journalists, editors, and open-source hackers to work with the project's creators to install, configure, and extend the platform in their newsroom.  We'll discuss the successes and failures we encountered throughout our beta test with six non-profit newsrooms and brainstorm potential means of extending the platform moving forward.  If all goes well, we'll help technically-inclinded audience members actually deploy an instance of NewsLynx.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/eads">David Eads</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Many events and projects now have a Code of Conduct. This is a wonderful step towards creating safe spaces.

Such codes encourage good behavior, but they  cannot prevent harassment and violence. When bad things happen, what are we going to do? 

This session will discuss de-escalation tactics, reporting mechanisms, enforcement, transparency vs. privacy, and how to achieve justice when harassment or violence happens.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com//a">Elizabeth Berg</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/wfmu">Ken Freedman</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">An exploration of how various media sites try to build community via comment sections, chat boards and other platforms. What has been successful and what has failed miserably? Can media sites build enough community through platforms like these, and can that community then harness crowdfunding into a new model for media sustainability? Many legacy media institutions have all but given up on the idea of audiences talking back, but other smaller institutions have harnessed their communities into a new model for media sustainability. What works?</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/eads">David Eads</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Not-for-profit ventures in the journalism world and beyond are too quick to seek grant and foundation funding.

Projects like FreeGeek Chicago and the Anti-Oppression Resource and Training Alliance in the Bay Area use community-based funding models that don't rely on rich philanthropists to sustain their work. 

What can such projects teach journalism ventures? What does community accountability and self-sustainability mean for journalism projects? How can startup journalism projects learn from the strong ethical frameworks developed by old school media to ensure independence from the interests of their owners and funders?</p>

        <p class="session-description">Our data store's been up and running for more than a year now. It's been a money-maker (good!), a vehicle to widely distribute free, open data (even better!) and, at times, a schedule-busting timesuck (bad!). If you’re interested in monetizing your data, let’s talk. How can we best strike a balance between honest pay for honest work and journalism's open, accessible ethos? What’s the best way to design a site meant to sell items, not stories? How should we determine the “value” of data? How can we navigate the fine line balance between journalist and salesman/woman? These and more pecuniary philosophical questions await.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/crushgear">Stephanie Yiu</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Collaborating with team members based out of another office, bureau, city or even country is really hard. At its very worst, you can feel slow, frustrated, and disconnected. At its best, you will feel flexible, motivated, and energized. 

This session will discuss the different tools and techniques organizations can use to help teams be effective while working from different cities, time zones, even continents. 

Topics to discuss: When should you opt for asynchronous, realtime, or in-person communication? How should we log work so that progress is not lost or hidden in email? What tools (Slack, gchat, Basecamp, Facebook groups) work for different types of teams? How do you handle breaking news situations across time zones? How do you foster brainstorming, creativity and team building remotely? How do you train and onboard new team members remotely? How do you keep remote folks motivated and a part of the team?</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/amyjo_brown">AmyJo Brown</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">What are your best workflows? How do you manage communication? How do you decide which tools to use? How do you get adoption for those tools? How do you handle personality conflicts? How do you ensure each team member feels ownership of the project? Does everyone need to be a "team player" — or can we make room for those other loveable or respected personalities in the newsroom who have valuable skills and ideas to contribute? 

This is inspired by a session held earlier this year at NICAR — it was great. Let's spend more time on this topic.</p>

        <h2 class="session-title"><a href="#proposal-116709">How can we best monetize data — and do so responsibly, ethically and without sacrificing journalistic standards? <span class="permalink">&para;</span></a></h2>
        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/amyjo_brown">AmyJo Brown</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">As journalists, we know how useful LexisNexis can be. Companies do, too. And they are spending millions to build or buy sophisticated CRM systems that track and link their customers through not just social media and online buying preferences but also through public records. But we also know how flawed the data collected by these CRM systems and LexisNexis can be. Public records are not necessarily clean data. Nor do they often tell full stories on their own.

Having access to good data within the right context is immensely valuable. That’s in part why we’ve seen data stores such as ProPublica’s and the Texas Tribune’s show such promise. As we consider revenue streams to support good journalism, data may be one of those that gives us the resources and the independence we need. 

Let’s talk about how to best monetize data responsibly, ethically and without sacrificing journalistic standards. Proposed topics for discussion include: 

* What datasets should newsrooms be collecting as a matter of course — what is valuable? How should we define “valuable”?

* How should these datasets be published? How much fact-checking is the right amount of fact-checking, particularly with significantly large datasets? What standards (if there should be standards) need to be put in place re: ideas such as version control, auditing back to the source and linking people within datasets? 

* Should all data be published? What are our responsibilities in terms of protecting privacy? How might our decisions on what to publish affect open records laws — could we see a backlash and how much should concern over that factor into our decision-making on what to publish? (For example, whether or not home addresses can be released by government agencies has been a huge topic in Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth Court recently ruled that agencies can’t release home addresses under the Right-to-Know Law without informing each person that his/her address would be released and giving them a chance to contest it. But this ruling doesn’t seem to apply to the release of home addresses in the voter registration database. Yet. If we use the voter registration database to map voters, how granular do we want to be in what we publish? How might that decision affect the state’s ongoing debate about the openness of those records?) 

* Let’s also talk about how, technically, these data “libraries” could be built — how can this idea of monetizing data work practically and efficiently, especially for small to mid-sized newsrooms?</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/maxogden">Maxwell Bridger Abraham Leonidas Herb Ogden</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sethdvincent">Seth Vincent</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Bring a computer with a web browser and/or command-line terminal to this session and learn how to use the Dat data version control tool in combination with the Flatsheet data editor application to version control, push, pull, diff and merge datasets.

Here's what we will cover in the workshop:

- Sending a data "pull request"
- Merge data contributions from others
- Set up data import pipelines to wrap legacy data sources/formats
- Update local copies of data with new changes
- Revert back to old versions of data
- Compare two versions of a dataset

We will have some example datasets to use, but also feel free to bring your own raw data to try out as well. Part of the workshop will be on the command-line, and part will be in the Flatsheet web application. You will need to install both the Dat command line-tool and the Flatsheet application on your own computer, and you will be able to do this at the start of the workshop (it only takes a couple of minutes).

Some basic command-line experience (Mac, Linux or Windows) is necessary to get the most out of this workshop.

More about Dat and Flatsheet:

Dat (http://dat-data.com/) is an open source version control and data sharing tool for data sets. It comes with a command line tool called 'dat' that lets you do things like 'dat pull', 'dat diff', 'dat merge' and 'dat push'. The goal of dat is to let you automate your data workflows so you can share and consume changes to datasets with others easily.

Dat is funded by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and has a primary goal of being used by scientists to publish data for reproducible research and collaboration. It is currently in 'beta'.

Flatsheet lets you edit data sets in realtime with your team. If you've used Google Spreadsheets with a library like Tabletop.js to create an ad-hoc mini-CMS, Flatsheet solves that problem more effectively, and is an open-source tool you can host on your own server. Flatsheet integrates with Dat, so you can use Dat to clone any sheet, edit locally, and push changes back to Flatsheet.

Flatsheet recently received a grant from the Knight Prototype Fund, as well as a code sprint grant from OpenNews. You can see a work-in-progress example at http://data.seattle.io</p>

        <p class="session-description">As a college intern, I received a crash course in databases when I asked the system administrator a basic question. Let's do something similar for each other. We will start by helping people graduate from Excel to MySQL by demystifying how data is broken down into individual nuggets and stored in tables. Then move to how SQL queries are created by joining the appropriate columns. Finally, we'll make sure everyone knows how to get data back out! At the end we'll have a shareable list of tip sheets, best practices, and further reading.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Have you been wanting to know more about Docker but haven’t found the time to dive in yet? Does your laptop sometimes feel like a tangled web of environments, dependencies, and different versions of software? Are you tired of hearing the annoying phrase “but it works for me!”? Boy, have we got something for you — Docker, an open platform for developers to build, ship, and run distributed applications. And what if we told you that you could get all those benefits AND it’s faster than virtual machines? Not possible, you say. But it is! You want bare-metal performance? That comes standard! But wait, there’s more! You need it to be repeatable? You got it! Docker also means less installation of endless requirements and dependencies per project. That’s a whole lotta simplification. In our session, we’ll go over how we use Docker in our workflow and get you ready to integrate it into your newsroom’s workflow. You can dip your toes in by phasing in Docker elements; it’s not an all-or-nothing platform. We’ll get you ready to run Docker on your laptop and make sure you understand key Docker concepts, including Dockerfiles, linking, publishing ports, and volumes. The concepts we’ll go over will be applicable to running containers in general, whether that’s using Docker, Rocket, or a similar tool. We’ll build on the syllabus found here: https://github.com/texastribune/docker-workshop, and we’ll also include a curated list of tutorials and other resources for you to keep learning. You can do it!</p>

Once you find them how do you quickly get past learning curves, integration risks, and limitations of the project?  How do you improve upon that project in a way that meets your goals while giving back in a meaningful way to the community?

This session is a chance for open source newbies and veterans alike to share stories, tips, tricks, and resources.  Together we will put together a first draft for an official guidebook to help journo-technologists feel more comfortable turning to open source first.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Today comments are the most common form of community on news sites, but is that all there is? Comment sections are usually just an afterthought and perceived only as an obligation - in this session we'll explore the unrealized value of comments and other forms user-generated content can take. We'll talk about our learnings thus far from the Coral Project, including the challenges news orgs currently face in creating successful digital communities and some existing solutions from journalism and ~beyond~.

Together we'll come up with our ideal online communities and think about concrete ways in which we can integrate these ideas into newsrooms' approaches to content co-creation. If you were building a news community from scratch, where would you start? What are the ways your audience would contribute or express themselves? How would you encourage inclusive and vibrant conversations? What limits would you set, if any?</p>

His three room approach to brainstorming took the most fantastical ideas, and developed them into something timeless. How can we bring that approach to the newsroom? How can we encourage our teams to think like Disney dreamers who bring big ideas to life?</p>

        <p class="session-description">Interested in using maps to identify food deserts, compare neighborhood distances to voting polls, or calculate the population within a flood zone? Are you guilty of creating overlapping geographic layers to show correlations?

While many newsrooms use maps to visualize geographic information — everything from election results to wildfires — a few simple techniques can make those maps more informed and insightful.

We’ll show you how to interview geographic data using network analysis and discuss a few common concepts (buffers, spatial joins, distances, etc). We’ll talk about how specific stories have analyzed geodata using a combination of free tools such as QGIS, turf.js, and leaflet.js. Afterward, we’ll open the floor for you to share your own experiences and questions. If you have your own favorite techniques or tools, give them a shout out!

This session is for beginner and intermediate data journalists who have used maps in their reporting, or for anyone who wants to go beyond simple geographic visualizations.</p>

        <p class="session-description">We all know the audience should be at the centre of our thinking when commissioning and creating news apps. But what are the actual processes different newsrooms follow to make sure they are? What questions do they ask? What exercises do they conduct? How do they talk about users and their needs? I would conduct a survey of news apps teams ahead of SRCCON, provide that information to attendees and then facilitate a discussion.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Engaging with scientific research gives you access to powerful data and sources with deep, expert knowledge on your topic. But even when you walk through the door with widespread scientific consensus on your side, getting sources to engage with that reality, especially outside their core expertise, can be difficult. Very smart people are perfectly capable of epic denial and rationalization. It's not just climate change, and it's not just red states. Earthquakes in Oklahoma, catastrophic drought in California, take your pick. When a professor of structural engineering tells you earthquake predictions are "just speculation," what's the best way to push the conversation forward?</p>

        <p class="session-description">As we design data stories, most of us naturally lean toward visualization and graphic representation. But it doesn’t have to be this way: Take Radiolab’s use of a chorus to demonstrate the color vision of mantis shrimp, or the New York Time’s use of tonal blips to show the difference in finishing time between Olympic medalists. (Find these examples and more at http://listentodata.tumblr.com/.) Audio is a rich, intimate medium that can convey some ideas - like the passage of time - better than graphics and allows you to layer information in sophisticated ways.

In this hands on session, I challenge you to think outside the data visualization box and tell a data story using sound as the primary medium. In small groups, we’ll prototype data audioizations using real datasets. We’ll also brainstorm what tools, technologies, software and best practices newsrooms can use to incorporate data audioization into their work.</p>

You know who's great at doing social science? Social scientists. This session explores how journalists can work with academics to inform the public in new ways. It would examine some extremely powerful - and popular - examples of the stories hacks, hackers and (ahem) hackademics can tell when they work together effectively, as well as some examples where things have not quite gone to plan.

Participants could discuss their own experiences, especially what challenges they have faced, and how they overcame them.</p>

        <p class="session-description">It's been 10 years since chicagocrime.org won a Batten award for innovation in journalism. In that decade hackers have joined the ranks of newsrooms large and small, and then left newsrooms to join startups and non-profits (If they Left newsrooms is that good or bad?). We now have many tribes of news nerds, journo-hackers, data wranglers and user experience researchers. Let's take a step back and see how large our community has grown. Who are we? What jobs do we have? How are our teams built? What problems are we trying to solve? What are the ingredients of a successful team?

We plan to do a survey leading up to SRCCON  to take stock of anyone who identifies with the DATA-journo-tech-design community. We'll present the results at SRCCON and then lead a discussion about what we found: Are we missing some key members of our community? Are we tackling the right problems? Are we learning the right skills and reaching out to the right people? How do we help news organizations create and sustain great teams?

We don't know, but it's been a decade since our little community got started. Let's find out who we are.</p>

What is currently missing from opportunities and resources?  Can we build them?  Let’s have a conversation about paired coding as a model for learning and developing expertise.  Participants will leave this session with a better understanding of paired programming and concrete ideas for how to incorporate it into their self-directing learning.   We will start with a group discussion of pair programming, including illustrative examples and then work in small groups to identify potential strategies and ideas to incorporate pair programming into your own work and your team.</p>

        <p class="session-description">You were the only developer or designer in the newsroom. You have a workflow and framework that works perfectly for you. Everything is in control. Now you have a second person on the team. Not only can the other person help you with daily deadlines, but you need to develop a framework and a workflow that makes it easy for both of you to collaborate and will give this team the potential to grow. This is a challenge, but also an opportunity. 

Here's what we want to talk about: What decisions are there to make? What should we take into consideration? Static vs. dynamic news apps? Ruby, Python or Javascript? Live in the CMS or create stand alone pages? What open source tools work best for us? What are we missing here? 

There isn’t a single right answer to these questions. The challenge is how to make decisions.  We feel this could be an opportunity not only for small teams to learn best practices, but also for bigger teams to rethink their model and share their experiences. We will produce a document to collect ideas. It will be a resource for newsrooms, walking people through the decision-making process to find the best approach. We also expect to update this after the conference as the conversation evolves.</p>

How we talk about what we do, how everyone else talks about it, and how those conceptual underpinnings become manifest, has a direct effect on on our growing field. It shapes who we can recruit, what we’re permitted to do and how our work is valued.

We don’t have answers to any of this, which is why we want to hear from people established in the field, those just starting out and everybody in between. Outside perspectives are also welcome.

We’ll share our experiences with perceptions shaped by language choice and we’ll ask others for theirs. Attendees will sketch out preliminary definitions for some of these terms, then will discuss what works and when. We don’t expect to walk out with a perfect blueprint or final answers — cultural change takes more than one conversation — but we hope to advance our collective thinking and leave slightly more confident in how we describe ourselves.</p>

        <p class="session-description">At DataMade, we’ve been building robots like dedupe and parserator to do the laborious and boring work of extracting, cleaning, and linking data. These tools are great for structured tabular files, but much of the valuable data we need are still locked away in paper documents. Let’s talk about extracting structured information from these messy paper forms.

Over the past five years, the open source computer vision library OpenCV has become very powerful, and through wrappers, great documentation, and tutorials, it has also become accessible to mere mortals (well, you still need to know how to program). 

While there have already been applications of computer vision techniques in the newsroom --image and map stitching (schooner-tk) and table extraction from PDFs (Tabula) --the opportunities remain largely unexplored. 

In this hands-on session, we’ll review OpenCV techniques applied to the terrifying problem of extracting data from HANDWRITTEN, SCANNED, PAPER FORMS.

Thinking about “culture,” precisely and vigorously, comes in especially handy when your team needs to onboard junior members, or when there’s a on-the job learning happening (which is, let’s admit it, all the freaking time). 

Using techniques and advice from an industry that is all about making communication and relationships healthier, we’ll work together in this interactive workshop to create better frameworks for how we give and receive feedback. Participants will leave with actionable strategies for how to make space for criticism on their teams, how to wrangle all the egos, and simple ways we can encourage and support each other as we build things every day.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Attending conferences with a like-minded community is inspiring, motivating and affirming. We go home full of ideas and energy and hope. Then our day-to-day life creeps back in and it gets hard to move those new ideas forward, becomes tricky to make space for learning the new skills we want, and we can feel isolated from the community we build here. If you can’t attend a conference at all, you can feel all of the above times two. 

After the conferences, how do we keep that inspiration and how do we stay accountable? For those who don’t have access to conferences or events, how can we make our community — and the inspiration we share — accessible all of the time? What are the obstacles that prevent us from making things happen? How might we build each other and our community up in the day to day, the quiet interludes between the big tent revivals?

During this session we’ll work together to identify major obstacles that prevent follow through, and small groups will brainstorm ways to address those obstacles. We’ll leave with a clear sense of how we can collaborate with, contribute to and build our community outside of a conference bubble.</p>

We’ll share our experiences and talk about strategies for making the difficult calls -- usually, “to build or not to build?” -- that small teams inevitably face, as well as about how to make responsible, forward-looking choices regarding where to focus your code resources.

        <p class="session-description">Design's user-centric orientation places the needs and expectations of users at the center of the designer's decision-making process. Journalism’s objectivity ethos has journalists striving to report on facts (and not their personal attitude toward facts), with fairness and accuracy. 

With newsrooms embracing new skill sets and welcoming more collaboration between people with a variety of professional backgrounds, different practices and traditions collide. Where is the line between designing for an audience and pandering to that audience? 

In this session we explore user-centered design’s fit in the newsroom and the processes of reporting, and how characterizing the audience for a story shapes decisions about what, how when and where a story is told.</p>

        <p class="session-description">No matter how useful a piece of open source software is, documentation is often the difference between whether it flourishes or dies a quiet death. But writing the docs is still an afterthought for a lot of developers, something to check off a list at the last minute before moving on. The end result is a lot of wasted potential, great tools that put off potential users because nobody can figure out how they work.

In this session, we'll discuss patterns of effective documentation and our own experiences as both readers and writers. How do we balance readability and precision? How do we write docs that serve both beginners and experts? How do we choose good examples? How do we make writing the docs a first-class citizen of any project, something that feels integral and not like extra homework? When we're reading docs, what makes things click and what makes us give up? Finally, we'll split up into groups and break out the red pens for close readings of documentation from a selection of popular libraries, and maybe even make some pull requests with our edits.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryJo Webster">MaryJo Webster</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CJSinner">C.J. Sinner</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">The workflow system of getting text (i.e. stories), photos and static graphics into the printed editions of newspapers has evolved over literally 100+ years and it is now a very, very refined process in every newsroom we’ve been in. Putting those same items on digital has essentially just been tagged onto the end of that process. But in many newsrooms this workflow doesn't work well for digital-only work, particularly when it involves data. 

We’d like this session to be a work-group format with a goal to create the ideal workflow -- from idea germination to publication. This should include best practices for communication flows, deadlines, how/when items will be edited (for usability, clarity, style, grammar, spelling, etc), process for creating/sharing/discussing mockups, first drafts, etc. A very key piece should be who should be included in the process and when (and by “who” we want to identify skillsets, rather than specific job titles). Some of the questions that could be used as part of this discussion include: How and when should people (i.e. reporter, data wranglers, devs, editors, copy editors) get looped in? What are realistic time frames for getting a digital-only project completed (obviously dependant on the scope)? How should deadlines be used in this workflow? What skillsets are needed (this goes back to the “who” is involved piece) to ensure you’re producing high-quality digital product? 

We’d like to split into three groups, each working on their own proposed workflows to address three different scenarios: 1) a digital product that accompanies an enterprise story that is weeks or months in the making, 2) a digital product that needs to be done quickly (either daily or short-term), either with or without a story
and 3) a stand-alone digital-only product, such as a news app or tool which does not heavily feature a text component.

We realize many people attending the session come from organizations where there are a lot of road bumps that might need to be fixed before such a system could be put into place, but we don’t want to spend this session just talking about the problems. At the end of the session, we’ll combine the three groups to discuss the implementation piece. Who has had success? What worked, what didn't? How do you convince higher-ups that this should be a priority? How do you cut through the office politics?

We want to come up with an ideal workflow that can be used by newsrooms as a goal to achieve, since each newsroom will likely have its own unique problems to resolve before achieving it.</p>

What is the equivalent for learning &amp; practicing journalism?
If you could create a news organization focused on teaching newcomers to the field with volunteer chapters across the country, what would that look like? What are the financial, editorial, educational, and organizational considerations? Anyone can start a local news blog, but what kind of infrastructure and education would best sustain these efforts? How might a distributed news organization be created using the community-building practices and tools of open source software? 
In this session we'll break into groups to invent a news organization that uses the same tools as open source software, that is informed by inclusive community organizing practices, and that provides a learning laboratory where people are producing news in public as they learn.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Many good ideas come out of journalists who are enthusiastic about their beats and the opportunity to capture large audiences. But there are lots of them, and only one or two of us. So how do you say no to good ideas, while keeping those good ideas flowing? How do you tell senior editors that you don’t have the resources when they want Snowfall? How do you determine which of the good ideas has the most value journalistically, and/or most potential for audience, social sharing or revenue? Doing this poorly leads to missed opportunities, time wasted on projects with no legs or shelf life, journalistic flaws, poor execution because of overbooking your time or unrealistic expectations — and burnout from long hours, nights and weekends. Doing it well strengthens our journalism, builds audience and reputation, opens new revenue opportunities and leads to even more good ideas.

        <p class="session-description">Programming creates so many technical and creative inventions that it's natural for aspiring programmers to dream of big projects in the cloud. But this ambition ignores the actual goal of programming, which is almost completely about making machines do mundane work. And it is counterproductive to learning how to program, which requires consistent practice as in every other form of literacy and art. 
 
So this session will be about mundane programming. Programming not to be the next Zuckerberg, or to get a better job 3 months from now, but to make today or just the next ten minutes more enjoyable. Instead of focusing specifically on how to code, we'll expand upon the reasons of why we code (though seeing is often believing when it comes to code, so feel free to bring both ideas and Gists). And we'll trim the personal prerequisites of programming, which don't include being an entrepreneur, having a profitable idea, building a website, contributing to open source, or changing the world or your career. Programming can be learned, and done, with a willingness to learn and a wide variety of small problems to practice upon.</p>

Let's make a kite and go for a walk around a Minneapolis lake or two. (Note: this requires some wind. But fear not, if there is no wind the backup plan is to do (helium) ballon mapping instead. Still cheaper than a drone). After kite-flying we'll have a look at the photos, stitch them together, contribute it Open Street Map and talk about some cool kite mapping projects.

It's something Brian Krebs has written about a number of times and it made me wonder if reporters and sources are fully prepared to face challenges like trumped up charges based on forged evidence given to police, financial fraud etc...

In this session, I'd like to discuss methods for protecting yourself and your family both at home and abroad.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Machine learning is suddenly the new, hip thing in data journalism. But like every tool in a toolbox, it has some uses but is not a go-to tool in every situation. This session will look at how some journalists have used machine learning and in what situations it's best and in what situations it should be avoided.</p>
