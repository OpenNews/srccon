        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/ktzhu">katie zhu</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">We're all trying to do our best. To design the best thing we can, engineer the best solution we can, launch the best product we can.

Part of working on a team involves interfacing with colleagues, all of whom
have strengths and weaknesses – things they absolutely kick ass at which we should emulate, and maybe a few lessons where we can all learn to do better.

Giving feedback is not always easy, especially when being particularly honest. This session is aimed at people in management positions as well as individual contributors, aimed at soliciting a wide array of opinions and experiences in delivering good and bad feedback, tactics for approaching harder subjects, and sharing knowledge so we can all learn to be better.

The format would start with a framing question and a few examples of personal experiences where I had given or received feedback from colleagues. I also plan to solicit a few examples of experiences prior to the session to use as talking points to spark conversation among participants.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/tswicegood">Travis Swicegood</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Expertise syndrome is a silent killer of knowledge in information-based industries – whether that’s a news room or a tech shop. Remembering what it was like to use your tools when you didn't know what you didn't know makes it harder for you to communicate with people who are starting out. How do you put yourself in the beginner's mind? Can doing that help you create the next generation of experts in your community? This talk explores those themes and helps you find and implement strategies to share your knowledge in a way that's accessible to everyone, regardless of where they are on their journey.</p>

        <p class="session-description">In this community dialogue session, attendees will have the opportunity to learn about existing legal resources that are available to independent journalists and nonprofit or startup new organizations free of charge, to ask questions of First Amendment and media law attorneys, and to communicate their biggest needs when it comes to legal support.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/laurieskelly">Laurie Skelly</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bjlange">Brian Lange</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Just what the hell is a Markov Chain? What is the difference between a model and an algorithm? Is sentiment analysis amazing, useless, or both? 
What do you do when you are suddenly faced with a complicated or intimidating concept, so that you can understand, evaluate, and share the ubiquitous insights the data-mad world is feverishly extracting from our suddenly-accessible mountains of  information? And nerds: how can you better communicate to journalists, clients, or laypeople about the really important analyses you know they want or need to know about, if only you could formulate your thoughts in a comprehensible way? Most of us, from either side, know that Wikipedia at these critical moments has nothing to offer but cold betrayal sprinkled with greek characters and LaTeX. 
Like LaPlace said of probability theory, data science at its best is simply "common sense reduced to calculation." But how do you get through the calculation bits and back to the common sense?
As consultants and educators, we (the organizers) spend a lot of time explaining complicated quantitative concepts to humans who vary in background, motivation, perspective, affinity, and attention span. We've often dreamed of a collaborative resource where the world of machine learning, data science, applied math, statistics, what have you, and et cetera, are made comprehensible through the communicative tools of example, origin, metaphor, analogy, pictures, diagrams, storytelling and good old patient ELI5. 
In this session, we'll come armed with some curated examples from our experience, answer some pre-submitted questions, and (gulp) field live questions from attendees on the fly. Finally, we'll share draft concepts and designs for an open source home where this conversation can live and grow. With some buy-in, we (the organizers plus) can crack our knuckles and start coding up a knowledge repository where, through asking and answering, all interested parties can learn how to better communicate with each other, such that the common sense can be teased out of the mire of calculations in service of learning, sanity, and the greater good.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Working in news can be punishing, and over time, it can cause real emotional and physical damage. How do we get to a point where work-life balance -- however we define it for ourselves -- is an attainable thing, and not merely something that elicits a weary ¯\_(ツ)_/¯? Let's talk about why life in news can be so hard, how we can address the larger issues (and what's out of our control), and what we can do to take care of ourselves and each other.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/malev">Marcos Vanetta</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">It’s a well known agile methodology, but does it really suit your team? Newsrooms are very tricky — you have different actors with diverse backgrounds, and teams have high turnover rates. In a newsroom, you rarely work on the same project for more than six months and you usually have people working on different projects at the same time. Let’s talk about process in a newsroom. How do we measure the progress of a project and the velocity of your team. What other metrics can we use? And how can we improve communication?</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/cthydng">Cathy Deng</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">I love when journalists make the code for their data analyses available. But alas, making work *available* isn’t the same thing as making work *accessible* - scripts sitting around in a Github repo are still unfriendly and daunting to most. Even if you were to examine code in depth, it’d still lack context about the reasoning behind methodology, dead ends explored, etc. How can we better share context and reasoning - not just code? How can we share analyses in a way that doesn’t intimidate novice coders or non-coders? How can we publish work without doing, well, a bunch of extra work? Let’s share thoughts! I’ll also show you around the interactive Jupyter Notebook (previously iPython Notebook), a nifty tool that privileges exploration, contextualization, and sharing - a tool that’s practically designed for journo-nerds, in my humble opinion. Bonus: coding in an interactive Notebook is especially great for python beginners.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Time is a river, and every year spent making web things in a newsroom is different than the last. Platforms and capabilities are constantly evolving, and so are we. We learn new tools and phase out the old, and we shed responsibilities that no longer make sense. This is a chance to share the things you used to do: the software you've replaced, the expectations you've reset and the jobs you got tired of doing. Let’s have a conversation about what it took to get here and how we’ve gotten better.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Every year IRE does a roundup of computer assisted reporting / data journalism at the NICAR and IRE conferences, @knowtheory does a middling job of running http://www.reddit.com/r/newsapps (contributors welcome!) and you work in news (or related fields)!  Each of the conferences we attend share a different milieu and perspective on the space we share.  So lets get together and share examples of data journalism from the past year that have stuck with you.</p>

        <p class="session-description">We're not pressing widgets.  The success of the news and writing software are both dependent on having good people do challenging work.  But finding people can be hard.  How do you recruit?  How do you figure out whether a candidate is good through the lens of a few meetings?  If you're in an organization with constraints around hiring, how do you navigate them to make sure you end up with the best candidate?  And from the perspective of job hunters, there is a lot of conflicting advice for what makes one an attractive candidate and how to communicate to potential employers who you are.  There's a lot to be said about a process that's collaborative exploration at it's best but can feel competitive, combative or stressful.  There have to be ways we can make it better, and we should talk about them!</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjsquire">Sarah Squire</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Most news projects follow a similar path, but how many of us follow a set roadmap as we go? Being aware of project phases can help organize our thoughts and keep us from having to double back later, especially when we don't have a project manager to lead us. Let's start by writing out all the steps we take from pitch to publish and sorting them into project phases. Then we'll go through and see which ones we actually take the time to complete in our current jobs. By the end, we'll have a roadmap to build graphics, stories and products with a guide to steer us so we don't get lost on the way.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Software documentation and implementation manuals are difficult undertakings for many developers, but the challenges can be monumental for news nerds. Coding in direct response to current events requires fantastically rapid software engineering that usually moves much faster than the technology industry's other product development cycles. Documentation is thus often demoted even further than usual in order to allow for these tighter deadlines, but undocumented or poorly documented code isn't really useful to anyone beyond the original programmer, and bad documentation is often rightfully a catastrophic barrier to the process of open sourcing a project, which hurts everybody. Even if you don't ultimately intend to share your code, bad documentation means your own organization will find it more difficult to maintain – or, worse yet, to iterate on and reuse the next time it is needed for the next breaking story which has another tight deadline. This sucks! Let's try to help by discussing specific strategies for rapidly and effectively documenting source code in the publishing technology space, whether for internal use or eventual open source release, covering everything from the language used in Git commit messages and inline code comments to ticketing software and broader management perspectives.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/acin">Andrew Nacin</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Many newsrooms are now largely driven by APIs. These connect different content systems and applications, third-party data providers, and support graphics and interactives. Some provide organization content for partners and others who wish to do cool things.

Building APIs are not a trivial task -- they're really hard to do well. You want it to be easy for other developers to use it, easy to extend in the future, and easy to maintain. API design is a very subjective field, but there a number of best practices. Few documentation exists for best practices in newsroom APIs. Let's share the best practices we've all learned and collaborate on that document.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Someone comes to you with an idea, you find new data, or you need to add a feature to your project. Where do you start? How about a 15-minute, hyperactive brainstorm session. We'll test out a couple strategies, including Crazy Eights (eight sketches in five minutes), assumption busting, debating and Pictionary prototyping. We'll discuss symbols, vocabulary and tools we can use to express our ideas quickly and clearly to all stakeholders, and there will definitely be coloring involved. And did you think this was just about design? We'll discuss and try to apply these strategies to code, datasets and where to go for lunch.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/jgriffiths">Nathan Griffiths</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">As data and visual literacy increases in the newsroom and we build increasingly complex projects, how can we make sure that users don’t get left behind? How do we help onboard novice users to new data, new user interfaces and potentially new ideas – some of which may be presented in abstract graphical form?

“Guided tours” offer one such opportunity. By starting with familiar actions (like clicking through a series of buttons) we can walk users through a series of interactions that highlight significant aspects of a dataset, demonstrate UI operations or introduce multiple views, all with the goal of empowering users and encouraging them to engage and explore more fully.

Building on established graphical and UI patterns like stepper graphics, the “annotation layer” and mobile on-boarding guides, this session will explore the role of the guided tour as a method of introducing users to new visual representations and of encouraging the exploration of complex datasets. We’ll discuss some best practices and gotchas before participating in brief design reviews and user tests of several data visualizations that contain large datasets, unique interfaces and/or complex graphical representations.</p>

How can we add context and enticing entry points to turn that raw material into a resource for our readers? What approaches has your organization tried? What off-the-wall ideas would you like to try?
These questions are also relevant to the journalism we're producing now. Whether you're stretching the limits of the CMS or telling stories on platforms unlikely to exist a decade from now, how might you keep the archives of the future in mind? How do you balance the goals of preserving the content and preserving the material experience? How many Snapchat stories fit on a roll of microfilm? Let's find out, together.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/acin">Andrew Nacin</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Many media organizations have had giant, monolithic software and IT projects that stretched on for years. Some were somewhat successful; many were written off. Some are still ongoing.

Some organizations have used these failures to their advantage, leveraging them to create new teams within the newsroom, avoid existing IT structures, merge print and web operations, and the like. These projects and the challenges they face are not unique to media organizations. It turns out, the federal government is loaded with hobbled projects. In government, the failure that acted as the catalyst was healthcare.gov. After, the White House launched a new U.S. Digital Service and recruited some of the country's top digital minds to serve, to help transform government services.

It turns out, many of the problems we've all seen affecting large media organizations also affect large government agencies. As government has seen the same failures play out in dozens of projects, it means we're gaining a lot of experience in building effective digital services for citizens and federal employees. (Media organizations also need to build effective services for two constituencies -- its staff and its readers. ) For existing projects, we're getting really good at working through a series of plays to rescue them, and set teams and projects back on track.

This session will present what's been learned from the first year of the U.S. Digital Service, and how these lessons can be applied to building effective digital tools for writers and readers alike. We can discuss struggling projects at media organizations (you know, hypothetical struggling projects) and dream up how they might be rescued.</p>

Communication is essential in every organization, but especially crucial in a busy newsroom. Proper, healthy communication helps foster an inclusive environment, which in turn creates better products and a better foundation for a diverse culture.

        <p class="session-description">Last year, I helped facilitate a long session on how we can stop fighting the CMS. The group split into two distinct discussions, on writing/editing, specifically versioning, revisions, and collaboration (a la Editorially, at the time); and the content model, including structured stories (like Circa), assets, and how to define, use, and reuse bits of content. We didn't exactly settle for the easy topics, but a number of projects and experiments over the last year were launched to work through the problems and potential solutions we defined.

Content management remains a struggle at most media organizations — it's an unsolved problem. Many are building their own tools and workarounds. Others are using off-the-shelf solutions but with significant customizations. While some organizations are trying to reinvent it, there are many outstanding questions, and many other organizations don't have the resources to solve it all by themselves. No current solution, whether a piece of software, a service, or a custom-built solution, adequately fills journalism's growing content management needs. We need to keep pushing this technology further. Let's further explore this area and figure out how journalism can support and be supported by these important publishing cornerstones.</p>

However, to ensure that designers don’t treat journalists as clients it’s vital that we establish an understanding of each others’ roles. How can we educate our newsroom on the best way to ask for design help? How can we educate our designers to fully understand the needs of a particular story? At times, design is treated as an after thought, and sometimes a designer may implement a design decision before fully grasping a story. With some role reversal scenarios we will explore the pain points between journalists and designers such as  as well as brainstorm solutions.</p>

How often have you had to hit a web server for the same page multiple times? Caching your scrape makes these problems trivial to deal with. Learn how to load from cached copies of the website with a few lines of code. This technique will save you time and headaches while reducing server load on the other end of your scrape.

        <p class="session-description">Ignoring anything related to ads is a point of pride for a lot of newsroom developers. But there’s a major shift coming in how ads are sold, served, and measured, and it has huge implications for how news websites will be designed and built. If you work on a site that has ads, you should be getting ready for viewability.

Most ads are sold at a price per thousand impressions, and traditionally impressions are counted as soon as the ad is inserted into the page. But the “viewable impression” is counted only after the ad enters the browser’s viewport. For some sites, this means that HALF of all ads served might never be seen by a reader or paid for by an advertiser.

This session will provide an overview of online advertising in general, and ad viewability in particular. I'll cover the technologies used to measure viewability and how it might impact the design and development of news sites. Finally, I’ll provide some ideas for how newsroom developers can adapt to viewability, use it to their advantage, and even borrow some concepts to improve the news apps you develop.</p>

        <p class="session-description">In China, where a majority of the population browses the web via their smartphones, there's been an emphasis on building micro websites called "light apps." Light apps, in contrast to native apps (apps you install directly on your device), are small HTML5 websites that require no downloading, use heavy animation and usually only have one use. They're meant for short attention spans and are often built to promote products for companies or recap an events. This design approach got me thinking: How could we as journalists adapt this idea to tell micro stories to our readers? Rather than write a full story or build an interactive graphic, we could fashion "light apps" that get the point across in a slick manner and then are never looked upon again. In this session, we'll take a look at some existing light apps and brainstorm story ideas that could work for the format.</p>

But even with web pages getting heftier and heftier, the usability of our work does not have to suffer. The perception of performance is becoming less a factor of “how long until the page is fully loaded,” and more of “how soon can the user interact with it?” I'd like encourage a conversation about the current state of performance on the web. How can we provide our users' browsers with enough information to make our page usable as soon as possible, even with all our wiz-bang graphics and interactives? What's a performance budget, and how can we use it to keep ourselves honest about the performance of our apps and graphics? What tools can we use to test web performance? I'll talk about our efforts at The Texas Tribune and highlight the amazing work of others.

Bots can be magic by helping us with our daily tasks, building things for us, giving us updates about things we work on and by helping us better communicate with our colleagues at work. By taking advantage of existing online platforms like Slack or Twitter where we daily chat with our co-workers and friends, bots are one of the easiest and most satisfying ways to prototype interactive experiences and one of simplest methods to experiment with new methods of sharing and creating communities around news. In this session, we will work in groups to explore new ways of delivering news to our readers and creating online communities by inventing fun and interactive news bots for Slack and Twitter.

I work for Condé Nast, but I think what Andy Baio said is true: Never Trust a Corporation to do a Library's Job. We have to be vigilent to keep the lights on—let the paywalls nudge our readers to become subscribers—but we also have to help other institutions preserve our part of the cultural heritage, in its entirety.

There are many ways we might approach the question *how do you package up an entire publication's corpus?* I would like to consider a possibility we can make happen today, with existing commodity hardware and widely available software: the Portable Offline Wifi Solution.

How many databases should you be allowed to put in production? How do you monitor all of this stuff (both performance and errors)? When should you integrate with another service, when should you build it yourself? And now that you have all these internal services, how do you coordinate them?

We also rely heavily on custom-made images to promote our work on WSJ.com — a creative process that goes through a lot of internal debate. Does a photo work better than a chart? Should we spend a lot of time creating them or very little?

Third-party a/b testers were costly and seemed complex to implement. Click-tracking services through Omniture and Google Analytics seemed too bloated and difficult to monitor.

        <p class="session-description">Version control systems are indispensible for engineering teams,  but often afterthoughts in the tools used by writers and editors. The patterns for version control we employ today, invented for specific software development cases that don’t always fit our needs, often force us to shape our tools and practices in ways we might not realize. Let’s change that.

If we were to start from scratch, how might we design the kinds of version control systems that empower writers and news developers? How can we explain and facilitate powerful and complex version paradigms like branching and merging in the context of a reported article? How might we expose that process to our readers?

Let’s explore some of the implementations of existing version control structures—resilient storage, atomicity, concurrency—and  try to conceive of new ways to look at, modify, and understand our content and news applications.</p>

We've both found there's a fine line between being the newsroom cheerleader for new digital things and somehow finding yourself bombarded with requests from coworkers for troubleshooting all tech issues. 

We want to know what works in other small newsrooms to stay engaged with your colleagues, encourage them to bounce cool digital storytelling ideas off you, but discourage them from asking you to fix the printer/their iPhone/the TV. We've also pitched this topic to ONA15 and hope to take the dos/don'ts from SRCCON and adapt it for the broader audience.</p>

Based at times on what simply seems worth remembering during the life of a story or, at others, on strict guidelines of what passes the "impact bar." Over the past two years, we conceived of and constructed NewsLynx (http://newslynx.org) to address two needs: first, as an attempt to understand how and through what processes news organizations large and small are currently approaching the "impact problem" and second, if we could develop a better way — through building an open-source platform— to help those newsrooms capture the qualitative and quantitive impact of their work.

Coming two weeks after the official public release of NewsLynx, this session will serve as the first opportunity for journalists, editors, and open-source hackers to work with the project's creators to install, configure, and extend the platform in their newsroom.  We'll discuss the successes and failures we encountered throughout our beta test with six non-profit newsrooms and brainstorm potential means of extending the platform moving forward.  If all goes well, we'll help technically-inclinded audience members actually deploy an instance of NewsLynx.</p>

        <p class="session-description">As journalists, we know how useful LexisNexis can be. Companies do, too. And they are spending millions to build or buy sophisticated CRM systems that track and link their customers through not just social media and online buying preferences but also through public records. But we also know how flawed the data collected by these CRM systems and LexisNexis can be. Public records are not necessarily clean data. Nor do they often tell full stories on their own.

Having access to good data within the right context is immensely valuable. That’s in part why we’ve seen data stores such as ProPublica’s and the Texas Tribune’s show such promise. As we consider revenue streams to support good journalism, data may be one of those that gives us the resources and the independence we need. 

Let’s talk about how to best monetize data responsibly, ethically and without sacrificing journalistic standards. Proposed topics for discussion include: 

* What datasets should newsrooms be collecting as a matter of course — what is valuable? How should we define “valuable”?

* How should these datasets be published? How much fact-checking is the right amount of fact-checking, particularly with significantly large datasets? What standards (if there should be standards) need to be put in place re: ideas such as version control, auditing back to the source and linking people within datasets? 

* Should all data be published? What are our responsibilities in terms of protecting privacy? How might our decisions on what to publish affect open records laws — could we see a backlash and how much should concern over that factor into our decision-making on what to publish? (For example, whether or not home addresses can be released by government agencies has been a huge topic in Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth Court recently ruled that agencies can’t release home addresses under the Right-to-Know Law without informing each person that his/her address would be released and giving them a chance to contest it. But this ruling doesn’t seem to apply to the release of home addresses in the voter registration database. Yet. If we use the voter registration database to map voters, how granular do we want to be in what we publish? How might that decision affect the state’s ongoing debate about the openness of those records?) 

* Let’s also talk about how, technically, these data “libraries” could be built — how can this idea of monetizing data work practically and efficiently, especially for small to mid-sized newsrooms?</p>

        <p class="session-description">Bring a computer with a web browser and/or command-line terminal to this session and learn how to use the Dat data version control tool in combination with the Flatsheet data editor application to version control, push, pull, diff and merge datasets.

Here's what we will cover in the workshop:

- Sending a data "pull request"
- Merge data contributions from others
- Set up data import pipelines to wrap legacy data sources/formats
- Update local copies of data with new changes
- Revert back to old versions of data
- Compare two versions of a dataset

We will have some example datasets to use, but also feel free to bring your own raw data to try out as well. Part of the workshop will be on the command-line, and part will be in the Flatsheet web application. You will need to install both the Dat command line-tool and the Flatsheet application on your own computer, and you will be able to do this at the start of the workshop (it only takes a couple of minutes).

Some basic command-line experience (Mac, Linux or Windows) is necessary to get the most out of this workshop.

More about Dat and Flatsheet:

Dat (http://dat-data.com/) is an open source version control and data sharing tool for data sets. It comes with a command line tool called 'dat' that lets you do things like 'dat pull', 'dat diff', 'dat merge' and 'dat push'. The goal of dat is to let you automate your data workflows so you can share and consume changes to datasets with others easily.

Dat is funded by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and has a primary goal of being used by scientists to publish data for reproducible research and collaboration. It is currently in 'beta'.

Flatsheet lets you edit data sets in realtime with your team. If you've used Google Spreadsheets with a library like Tabletop.js to create an ad-hoc mini-CMS, Flatsheet solves that problem more effectively, and is an open-source tool you can host on your own server. Flatsheet integrates with Dat, so you can use Dat to clone any sheet, edit locally, and push changes back to Flatsheet.

Flatsheet recently received a grant from the Knight Prototype Fund, as well as a code sprint grant from OpenNews. You can see a work-in-progress example at http://data.seattle.io</p>

Boy, have we got something for you — Docker, an open platform for developers to build, ship, and run distributed applications. And what if we told you that you could get all those benefits AND it’s faster than virtual machines? Not possible, you say. But it is! You want bare-metal performance? That comes standard! But wait, there’s more! You need it to be repeatable? You got it! Docker also means less installation of endless requirements and dependencies per project. That’s a whole lotta simplification. In our session, we’ll go over how we use Docker in our workflow and get you ready to integrate it into your newsroom’s workflow. You can dip your toes in by phasing in Docker elements; it’s not an all-or-nothing platform. We’ll get you ready to run Docker on your laptop and make sure you understand key Docker concepts, including Dockerfiles, linking, publishing ports, and volumes. The concepts we’ll go over will be applicable to running containers in general, whether that’s using Docker, Rocket, or a similar tool.

But what are the actual processes different newsrooms follow to make sure they are? What questions do they ask? What exercises do they conduct? How do they talk about users and their needs? I would conduct a survey of news apps teams ahead of SRCCON, provide that information to attendees and then facilitate a discussion.</p>

        <p class="session-description">As we design data stories, most of us naturally lean toward visualization and graphic representation. But it doesn’t have to be this way: Take Radiolab’s use of a chorus to demonstrate the color vision of mantis shrimp, or the New York Time’s use of tonal blips to show the difference in finishing time between Olympic medalists. (Find these examples and more at http://listentodata.tumblr.com/.) Audio is a rich, intimate medium that can convey some ideas - like the passage of time - better than graphics and allows you to layer information in sophisticated ways.

In this hands on session, I challenge you to think outside the data visualization box and tell a data story using sound as the primary medium. In small groups, we’ll prototype data audioizations using real datasets. We’ll also brainstorm what tools, technologies, software and best practices newsrooms can use to incorporate data audioization into their work.</p>

You know who's great at doing social science? Social scientists. This session explores how journalists can work with academics to inform the public in new ways. It would examine some extremely powerful - and popular - examples of the stories hacks, hackers and (ahem) hackademics can tell when they work together effectively, as well as some examples where things have not quite gone to plan.

Participants could discuss their own experiences, especially what challenges they have faced, and how they overcame them.</p>

In that decade hackers have joined the ranks of newsrooms large and small, and then left newsrooms to join startups and non-profits (If they Left newsrooms is that good or bad?). We now have many tribes of news nerds, journo-hackers, data wranglers and user experience researchers. Let's take a step back and see how large our community has grown. Who are we? What jobs do we have? How are our teams built? What problems are we trying to solve? What are the ingredients of a successful team?

We plan to do a survey leading up to SRCCON  to take stock of anyone who identifies with the DATA-journo-tech-design community. We'll present the results at SRCCON and then lead a discussion about what we found: Are we missing some key members of our community? Are we tackling the right problems? Are we learning the right skills and reaching out to the right people? How do we help news organizations create and sustain great teams?

We don't know, but it's been a decade since our little community got started. Let's find out who we are.</p>

        <p class="session-description">You were the only developer or designer in the newsroom. You have a workflow and framework that works perfectly for you. Everything is in control. Now you have a second person on the team. Not only can the other person help you with daily deadlines, but you need to develop a framework and a workflow that makes it easy for both of you to collaborate and will give this team the potential to grow. This is a challenge, but also an opportunity. 

Here's what we want to talk about: What decisions are there to make? What should we take into consideration? Static vs. dynamic news apps? Ruby, Python or Javascript? Live in the CMS or create stand alone pages? What open source tools work best for us? What are we missing here? 

There isn’t a single right answer to these questions. The challenge is how to make decisions.  We feel this could be an opportunity not only for small teams to learn best practices, but also for bigger teams to rethink their model and share their experiences. We will produce a document to collect ideas. It will be a resource for newsrooms, walking people through the decision-making process to find the best approach.

How we talk about what we do, how everyone else talks about it, and how those conceptual underpinnings become manifest, has a direct effect on on our growing field. It shapes who we can recruit, what we’re permitted to do and how our work is valued.

We don’t have answers to any of this, which is why we want to hear from people established in the field, those just starting out and everybody in between. Outside perspectives are also welcome.

We’ll share our experiences with perceptions shaped by language choice and we’ll ask others for theirs. Attendees will sketch out preliminary definitions for some of these terms, then will discuss what works and when. We don’t expect to walk out with a perfect blueprint or final answers — cultural change takes more than one conversation — but we hope to advance our collective thinking and leave slightly more confident in how we describe ourselves.</p>

Let’s talk about extracting structured information from these messy paper forms.

Over the past five years, the open source computer vision library OpenCV has become very powerful, and through wrappers, great documentation, and tutorials, it has also become accessible to mere mortals (well, you still need to know how to program). 

While there have already been applications of computer vision techniques in the newsroom --image and map stitching (schooner-tk) and table extraction from PDFs (Tabula) --the opportunities remain largely unexplored. 

In this hands-on session, we’ll review OpenCV techniques applied to the terrifying problem of extracting data from HANDWRITTEN, SCANNED, PAPER FORMS.

We all know that we value a “good team culture,” but we’re often vague about what that means or how to achieve it. But what if it’s as easy as setting out your team practices as a checklist, the same way you would for any other project? For instance, making sure that individual interactions between team members — even arguments — are approached in an “actively positive” manner? Or ensuring that every team member agrees and understands the grounds on which a proposed feature is judged?  Thinking about “culture,” precisely and vigorously, comes in especially handy when your team needs to onboard junior members, or when there’s a on-the job learning happening (which is, let’s admit it, all the freaking time). 

Using techniques and advice from an industry that is all about making communication and relationships healthier, we’ll work together in this interactive workshop to create better frameworks for how we give and receive feedback. Participants will leave with actionable strategies for how to make space for criticism on their teams, how to wrangle all the egos, and simple ways we can encourage and support each other as we build things every day.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Attending conferences with a like-minded community is inspiring, motivating and affirming. We go home full of ideas and energy and hope. Then our day-to-day life creeps back in and it gets hard to move those new ideas forward, becomes tricky to make space for learning the new skills we want, and we can feel isolated from the community we build here. If you can’t attend a conference at all, you can feel all of the above times two. 

After the conferences, how do we keep that inspiration and how do we stay accountable? For those who don’t have access to conferences or events, how can we make our community — and the inspiration we share — accessible all of the time? What are the obstacles that prevent us from making things happen? How might we build each other and our community up in the day to day, the quiet interludes between the big tent revivals?

During this session we’ll work together to identify major obstacles that prevent follow through, and small groups will brainstorm ways to address those obstacles. We’ll leave with a clear sense of how we can collaborate with, contribute to and build our community outside of a conference bubble.</p>

We’ll share our experiences and talk about strategies for making the difficult calls -- usually, “to build or not to build?” -- that small teams inevitably face, as well as about how to make responsible, forward-looking choices regarding where to focus your code resources. We hope you'll learn how to avoid conjuring the Ghost of Tech Directors Future, even as you experiment and iterate in productive ways!</p>

        <p class="session-description">Design's user-centric orientation places the needs and expectations of users at the center of the designer's decision-making process. Journalism’s objectivity ethos has journalists striving to report on facts (and not their personal attitude toward facts), with fairness and accuracy. 

With newsrooms embracing new skill sets and welcoming more collaboration between people with a variety of professional backgrounds, different practices and traditions collide. Where is the line between designing for an audience and pandering to that audience? 

In this session we explore user-centered design’s fit in the newsroom and the processes of reporting, and how characterizing the audience for a story shapes decisions about what, how when and where a story is told.</p>

        <p class="session-description">No matter how useful a piece of open source software is, documentation is often the difference between whether it flourishes or dies a quiet death. But writing the docs is still an afterthought for a lot of developers, something to check off a list at the last minute before moving on. The end result is a lot of wasted potential, great tools that put off potential users because nobody can figure out how they work.

In this session, we'll discuss patterns of effective documentation and our own experiences as both readers and writers. How do we balance readability and precision? How do we write docs that serve both beginners and experts? How do we choose good examples? How do we make writing the docs a first-class citizen of any project, something that feels integral and not like extra homework? When we're reading docs, what makes things click and what makes us give up? Finally, we'll split up into groups and break out the red pens for close readings of documentation from a selection of popular libraries, and maybe even make some pull requests with our edits.</p>

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryJo Webster">MaryJo Webster</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CJSinner">C.J. Sinner</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">The workflow system of getting text (i.e. stories), photos and static graphics into the printed editions of newspapers has evolved over literally 100+ years and it is now a very, very refined process in every newsroom we’ve been in. Putting those same items on digital has essentially just been tagged onto the end of that process. But in many newsrooms this workflow doesn't work well for digital-only work, particularly when it involves data. 

We’d like this session to be a work-group format with a goal to create the ideal workflow -- from idea germination to publication. This should include best practices for communication flows, deadlines, how/when items will be edited (for usability, clarity, style, grammar, spelling, etc), process for creating/sharing/discussing mockups, first drafts, etc. A very key piece should be who should be included in the process and when (and by “who” we want to identify skillsets, rather than specific job titles). Some of the questions that could be used as part of this discussion include: How and when should people (i.e. reporter, data wranglers, devs, editors, copy editors) get looped in? What are realistic time frames for getting a digital-only project completed (obviously dependant on the scope)? How should deadlines be used in this workflow? What skillsets are needed (this goes back to the “who” is involved piece) to ensure you’re producing high-quality digital product? 

We’d like to split into three groups, each working on their own proposed workflows to address three different scenarios: 1) a digital product that accompanies an enterprise story that is weeks or months in the making, 2) a digital product that needs to be done quickly (either daily or short-term), either with or without a story
and 3) a stand-alone digital-only product, such as a news app or tool which does not heavily feature a text component.

We realize many people attending the session come from organizations where there are a lot of road bumps that might need to be fixed before such a system could be put into place, but we don’t want to spend this session just talking about the problems. At the end of the session, we’ll combine the three groups to discuss the implementation piece. Who has had success? What worked, what didn't? How do you convince higher-ups that this should be a priority? How do you cut through the office politics?

We want to come up with an ideal workflow that can be used by newsrooms as a goal to achieve, since each newsroom will likely have its own unique problems to resolve before achieving it.</p>

What is the equivalent for learning &amp; practicing journalism?
If you could create a news organization focused on teaching newcomers to the field with volunteer chapters across the country, what would that look like? What are the financial, editorial, educational, and organizational considerations? Anyone can start a local news blog, but what kind of infrastructure and education would best sustain these efforts? How might a distributed news organization be created using the community-building practices and tools of open source software? 
In this session we'll break into groups to invent a news organization that uses the same tools as open source software, that is informed by inclusive community organizing practices, and that provides a learning laboratory where people are producing news in public as they learn.</p>

        <p class="session-description">Many good ideas come out of journalists who are enthusiastic about their beats and the opportunity to capture large audiences. But there are lots of them, and only one or two of us. So how do you say no to good ideas, while keeping those good ideas flowing? How do you tell senior editors that you don’t have the resources when they want Snowfall? How do you determine which of the good ideas has the most value journalistically, and/or most potential for audience, social sharing or revenue? Doing this poorly leads to missed opportunities, time wasted on projects with no legs or shelf life, journalistic flaws, poor execution because of overbooking your time or unrealistic expectations — and burnout from long hours, nights and weekends. Doing it well strengthens our journalism, builds audience and reputation, opens new revenue opportunities and leads to even more good ideas.

        <p class="session-description">Programming creates so many technical and creative inventions that it's natural for aspiring programmers to dream of big projects in the cloud. But this ambition ignores the actual goal of programming, which is almost completely about making machines do mundane work. And it is counterproductive to learning how to program, which requires consistent practice as in every other form of literacy and art. 
 
So this session will be about mundane programming. Programming not to be the next Zuckerberg, or to get a better job 3 months from now, but to make today or just the next ten minutes more enjoyable. Instead of focusing specifically on how to code, we'll expand upon the reasons of why we code (though seeing is often believing when it comes to code, so feel free to bring both ideas and Gists). And we'll trim the personal prerequisites of programming, which don't include being an entrepreneur, having a profitable idea, building a website, contributing to open source, or changing the world or your career. Programming can be learned, and done, with a willingness to learn and a wide variety of small problems to practice upon.</p>

Let's make a kite and go for a walk around a Minneapolis lake or two. (Note: this requires some wind. But fear not, if there is no wind the backup plan is to do (helium) ballon mapping instead. Still cheaper than a drone). After kite-flying we'll have a look at the photos, stitch them together, contribute it Open Street Map and talk about some cool kite mapping projects.

        <p class="facilitator">Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/dataeditor">Steven Rich</a></p>
        <p class="session-description">Machine learning is suddenly the new, hip thing in data journalism. But like every tool in a toolbox, it has some uses but is not a go-to tool in every situation. This session will look at how some journalists have used machine learning and in what situations it's best and in what situations it should be avoided.</p>
