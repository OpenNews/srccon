<h2 id="venue-and-hotel-directions">Venue and hotel directions</h2>
<p>The conference hotel this year is the <a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/mspdc-courtyard-minneapolis-downtown/">Courtyard Minneapolis Downtown</a>, which is right near a stop on the light rail for easy travel from the airport and to the venue.</p>

<p>There’s a bunch of ways you can get to the conference venue from the hotel, which is a little over a mile away:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Complimentary Shuttle</strong> the hotel itself provides a shuttle that’s open to all guests from 7am-11pm daily, first-come, first-serve.</li>
  <li><strong>Transit</strong> the light rail Green Line, stops about 100 ft from the hotel front door at West Bank Station and drops off about a 5 minute walk from McNamara at Stadium Village Station on the other side. This is a 2-minute ride, with 5 minutes of walking, and the train comes every 10 minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>University Circulator Shuttle</strong> this bus is free and open to the public. It picks up about a block from the hotel at Mondale Hall and drops off at McNamara. It runs every 15 minutes from 7am-9:30pm.</li>
  <li><strong>Walking</strong> the walk is just about half an hour, as outlined in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/T5R7ecE4Vsvqq2Wj8">Google Maps</a>. The descriptive version is: Exit the hotel and head east on S Washington Ave which will turn into S 2nd Street as you pass 19th Ave. In about 150ft, just before the parking lot, you’ll turn right onto the sidewalk path, cutting through campus. Continue on the sidewalk east/southeast, around the University of MN Law School Building, until you see the Washington Ave Bridge. There is a walking/biking side of this bridge, and you’ll use this to head across the river to the East Bank campus. After exiting the bridge, continue east on Washington Ave for 1/4 of a mile. McNamara Alumni Center will be on your left, between Walnut and Oak.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.metrotransit.org/metro-system">Minneapolis METRO system</a> is an easy way to get around the city. You can ride light rail from the airport to the conference venue for $2: Follow the light rail signs to the airport tram, which will take you right to the light rail station. Take the northbound (“Downtown Minneapolis”) Blue Line to the U.S. Bank Stadium station, then cross to the other track to transfer to the eastbound Green Line. Take the Green Line two stops to East Bank. The <a href="http://www.mac-events.org/">McNamara Alumni Center</a> conference venue is a block past The Graduate hotel, on SE Oak Street.</p>

<p>You can also use transit to get to <a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/mspdc-courtyard-minneapolis-downtown/">the conference hotel</a>, the light rail Green Line stops about 100 ft from the hotel front door at West Bank Station. To get to the hotel from the stop, go up the stairs or take the elevator. Then, walk to your right to the intersection of 19th Avenue and S. Washington Avenue. Take a left down Washington Avenue, and the Courtyard will be ahead of you on the right. It’s a round building.</p>

All entrances to the building are on the ground floor, and don’t require stairs. 90% of the SRCCON meeting rooms are on the ground level, and there are 2 elevators for access to the 2nd and 5th floor session rooms. There are ADA compliant bathrooms on each floor that SRCCON is using.</p>
