<p><em>“You all are leading the way on how to have a great conference that is welcoming for everyone, and someday the tech industry will be so much better off when it adopts what you’ve done.”</em> –SRCCON attendee feedback</p>

<p><em>“This was the first conference I’ve been a part of where I felt I belonged on every level.”</em> –SRCCON attendee feedback</p>

<p>SRCCON is a journalism conference people love. This reaction comes from the approach SRCCON takes: highly participatory and extraordinarily inclusive; SRCCON is a conference where participants come first so they can focus on collaborating on the work at hand.</p>

<p>People come first at SRCCON. More than half of our attendees in 2017 were women, and nearly a third were people of color. Because our program is built by the community, and represents voices from all parts of it, more than a third of our participants in 2017 were session facilitators and even more led lunch conversations, workshops during our evening program, and field trips together into Minneapolis.</p>

<p>For journalism-technologists, newsroom leaders (both formal and informal), and others seeking to change journalism for the better, SRCCON is where they can sit down away from the deadlines and the day-to-day and learn from each other. We want you to help make that happen.</p>

<p>Sponsorship for SRCCON is changing: Instead of selling off bits and pieces of SRCCON, for our fifth year we’re simply looking for six Core Sponsors. Core Sponsors pay equal amounts, receive equal billing, and are the engine that drives all parts of SRCCON’s inclusive, human-centered conference.</p>

<p><strong>Core Sponsors make it possible for SRCCON to offer:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Scholarships for SRCCON participants</li>
  <li>Free childcare for all participants’ children</li>
  <li>Real-time transcription services in multiple session rooms</li>
  <li>All meals at SRCCON</li>
  <li>Coffee throughout SRCCON</li>
  <li>Thursday evening activities for SRCCON attendees</li>
</ul>

<p>Core Sponsors also take part in SRCCON, but not by sitting behind a booth. Instead, Core Sponsors attend and participate right alongside everyone else. With four tickets available to each Core Sponsor, this is an opportunity to enmesh yourself in this community by being a partner in the work instead of a salesperson. Being a Core Sponsor is a unique opportunity to engage with the vibrant community of people changing journalism for the better. Not sure who to send? We are happy to work with you to find the best people to get the most out of SRCCON.</p>

<p><strong>In return for Core Sponsorship you will receive:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>4 tickets to SRCCON</li>
  <li>Core Sponsorship signage at SRCCON in prominent locations.</li>
  <li>Recognition from the stage at opening and closing both days.</li>
  <li>Logo/link on the Core Sponsorship band on the SRCCON site.</li>
  <li>Logo/link on the Core Sponsorship band on SRCCON email communications.</li>
  <li>Logo and paragraph on the Core Sponsors page on the SRCCON site.</li>
</ul>

<p>SRCCON is a different kind of journalism conference, and it’s one that people have grown to deeply love over the last five years. By becoming a Core Sponsor you align your work with ours and become a part of building a better journalism, together.</p>

<p>Interested in having your company or organization become a Core Sponsor of SRCCON? <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#100;&#097;&#110;&#064;&#111;&#112;&#101;&#110;&#110;&#101;&#119;&#115;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">Get in touch with OpenNews Director Dan Sinker today.</a></p>

            <h3>About SRCCON events</h3>
            <p>OpenNews runs several journalism events each year. The largest is this conference: SRCCON, a mid-year conference for about 300 developers, designers, and data analysts. We also gather small working groups and convenings, and in 2017 added our first topically focused SRCCON-style event, <a href="https://work.srccon.org">SRCCON:WORK</a> in Philadelphia.</p>
