SRCCON sponsors help us keep our event cost low, help bring people to the event, and help with the special touches that make SRCCON SRCCON.

Last year, our sponsors helped us offer scholarships, underwrote our coffee-hacking stations, brought live transcription to SRCCON, and more. This year, we'll have even more opportunities for support.

Stay tuned for a detailed breakdown of sponsorship opportunities for SRCCON 2015, or [send us a note](mailto:dan@mozillafoundation.org) if you have questions in the interim.
