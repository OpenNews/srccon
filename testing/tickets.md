After last year's surprise three-minute sell-out, we expect tickets to sell very quickly, and we’re working on a sales process that is as fair and transparent as possible, and that takes time zones into consideration.

As part of our diversity and inclusion efforts, we are also actively working to make sure SRCCON tickets are available to people in smaller and non-coastal newsrooms and members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology.

You’ll see a lot more information on the ticketing process—and our rationales—in the coming weeks and months. In the meantime, please note that if you pitch a session we accept, you will be offered a chance to buy a ticket before the public sale opens, so think about those pitches.
