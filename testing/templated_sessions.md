Our call for proposals opens MONTH DAY, and closes MONTH DAY, and in the next few weeks, we’ll be posting more information about what we’re looking for, the selection process, and what it’s like to lead a session at SRCCON. We’ll also provide information about our evening programming options, which will range from lightning talks and skillshares to tabletop games and unstructured chill time.

You can check out last year’s schedule for a taste of the inaugural SRCCON, and a source of inspiration for your own amazing proposal.

**Please note**: If you propose a session that is selected, you will be given a chance to buy a ticket in advance of the public on-sale date, so pitching a great session is a good way to increase your chances of getting a ticket.
