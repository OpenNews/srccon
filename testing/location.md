SRCCON 2015 will be at the beautiful, spacious McNamara Alumni Center on the Twin Cities campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. The Alumni Center offers comfortable space for breakouts of all sizes, and will also host our evening sessions, skillshares, games, and lightning talks on the 25th.

Weâ€™re reserving a block of rooms at the adjoining Commons Hotel, where we will also offer licensed childcare, and there are other great lodging options nearby as well.

Many more details about lodging and logistics will arrive as the on-sale date approaches, including information about meals and childcare arrangements, plus restaurant, day-trip, and activity recommendations.
