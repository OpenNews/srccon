Our sponsors help us make SRCCON both special and accessible by keeping our ticket price well below cost, getting people to the event, and bringing in the special touches that make SRCCONâ€¦SRCCON.

Last year, our sponsors helped us offer scholarships, underwrote our coffee-hacking stations, funded live professional transcription, and more. This year, we'll have even more opportunities for support.

Stay tuned for a detailed breakdown of sponsorship opportunities for SRCCON 2015, or [send us a note](mailto:dan@mozillafoundation.org) if you have questions in the interim.
