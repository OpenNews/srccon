SRCCON returns for another two days of participatory sessions centered on the technical, ethical, design, and editorial challenges newsroom data and apps teams encounter every day. Delicious food, great coffee, and the chance to dig into hard questions with amazing people.

    <li class="left"><img src="cityscape.jpg"><h3>Location</h3><p>This year we meet on a beautiful university campus in Minneapolis, home of Prince, the Twins, and some very good restaurants.
    <li class="right"><img src="registration.jpg" class="right"><h3>Registration</h3><p>Tickets go on sale DATE MONTH, and if last year’s experience is any guide will probably sell out very quickly.
    <li class="left"><img src="location.jpg"><h3>Sessions</h3><p>SRCCON sessions are designed to put the best serendipity of larger events—hallway conversations, late-night dinner chats, and spontaneous end-of-panel discussions—at the center of a conference.
