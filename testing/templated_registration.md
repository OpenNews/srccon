After last year’s surprise three-minute sell-out, we expect tickets to go quickly, and we’re working on a process that is as fair and transparent as possible. In the interim, some basic information. There are three primary ways to obtain a SRCCON ticket:

* Open sales: first-come, first-served, with a limit of 3 tickets per transaction
* Pitch an accepted session: if you propose a session and we accept it, you’ll be given a chance to reserve a ticket before the open sale begins
* Scholarships: we offer a limited number of scholarships that provide a stipend to reduce the cost of attendance—if you apply for a scholarship and are accepted, you’ll be given a chance to reserve a ticket before the open sale begins

We also set aside a small number of free conference passes for SRCCON volunteers, current Knight-Mozilla fellows, and sponsor representatives, and may extend presale invitations to reserve a ticket to members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology. Session proposals, scholarship applications, and volunteer applications open on MONTH DATE, and close on MONTH DATE.
