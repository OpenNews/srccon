SRCCON 2015 will be at the beautiful, spacious McNamara Alumni Center on the Twin Cities campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. The Alumni Center offers comfortable space for breakouts of all sizes, and will also host our evening sessions, skillshares, games, and lightning talks on the 25th.

We’re reserving a block of rooms at the adjoining Commons Hotel, where we will also offer licensed childcare. There are other great lodging options nearby, and we’ll post details on all of them, plus our childcare arrangements and restaurant, day-trip, and activity recommendations from real live locals as the on-sale date approaches.
