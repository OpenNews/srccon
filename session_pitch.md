#Propose a Session

Proposing a session only takes a few minutes, and we're here to help. We're [publishing already submitted proposals here](/sessions/proposals) (minus private info), and our [sessions page](/sessions) includes examples and detailed guidance. If you have questions or get stuck, [send us a note](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) and we'll get back to you ASAP.

So tell us, whatâ€™s your perfect SRCCON session?
