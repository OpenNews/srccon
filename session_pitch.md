#Propose a Session

Proposals will be published on this site (fields marked as private excepted), and the sessions we accept will form the program for the two-day conference.  [Check out the session page](srccon.org/sessions) for examples and more detailed guidance on proposing a session, and feel free to [contact us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) if you have any questions about your proposal.

So tell us, whatâ€™s your perfect SRCCON session?
