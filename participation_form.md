# Call for Participation

We're excited that we've been able to open up a second batch of tickets to SRCCON and that you're interested in participating at SRCCON 2018! We ask that you tell us a little about yourself and your work. This form is how we will allocate the remaining tickets for SRCCON. We're reviewing applications on a rolling basis and the form will remain open as long as there are tickets available. 

For a sense of what we'll be getting into this year at SRCCON, [take a look at the accepted sessions list](/sessions). You can also learn about the [overall SRCCON program](/program) and our [CFP process](/participation/faq).

Please feel free to reach out to us at [srccon@opennews.org](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) with any questions. Or if youâ€™re all set, the participation form is below!
