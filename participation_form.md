# SRCCON 2018 Call for Participation

We can't wait to hear how you'd like to participate at SRCCON 2018! If you want to attend, facilitate a session, or take part in some other way, this one form is where to let us know.

If you're working on a session idea, we highly recommend reading through [our guide to crafting a great session proposal](/sessions/proposal-guide). Also, we have a [question-by-question walkthrough](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon-participation-howto) if you want some guidance on this form (and a glimpse at all the questions it contains). Please feel free to reach out to us at [srccon@opennews.org](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) with any questions. Or if you're all set, the participation form is below!
