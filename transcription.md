# Transcription

It's important to us to keep SRCCON small enough to feel friendly and conversational, but we also care about getting the ideas and conversations that take place at SRCCON into the wider world. The most important way this happens is when attendees return to their home newsrooms and put their new skills and approaches to work, but we also document SRCCON as extensively as possible.

Our live-captioning team transcribes about half the sessions at SRCCON. Sessions with stenographers are marked on [our full schedule](https://schedule.srccon.org), or you can use the lists below. If your team uses Slack, you can also [add our Slackbot](/slackbot) to get reminders when transcribed sessions are about to start. After the conference, we'll update the links here to cleaned-up archives.

<div>
    <h3>Thursday transcribed sessions</h3>
    <table>{% assign thursday = site.data.schedule | where:"day","Thursday" %}
{% for session in thursday %}
        {% if session.transcription != "" %}<tr><td>{{ session.time }}</td><td><a class="session-title" href="https://aloft.nu/conf?name=srccon&session=2018-{{ session.id }}">{{ session.title }}</a></td></tr>{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
    </table>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Friday transcribed sessions</h3>
    <table>{% assign friday = site.data.schedule | where:"day","Friday" %}
{% for session in friday %}
        {% if session.transcription != "" %}<tr><td>{{ session.time }}</td><td><a class="session-title" href="https://aloft.nu/conf?name=srccon&session=2018-{{ session.id }}">{{ session.title }}</a></td></tr>{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
    </table>

## Write-Ups

In the leadup to SRCCON 2018, weâ€™re featuring a selection of Q&As with session facilitators about the topics they're bringing to this year's event. You can [keep up with the series on Source](https://source.opennews.org/articles/tags/srccon-2018/).

After this year's SRCCON, we'll also publish a series of session summaries [on Source](https://source.opennews.org), digging into the things people learned during conversations and workshops.in the weeks that follow the conference. If you publish your own writeups or blog posts, we'd love to [hear about them](mailto:source@opennews.org) so we can help you share them with everyone!
