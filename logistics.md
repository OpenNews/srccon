## Lodging

The block of rooms at this year's conference hotel has sold out! The conference hotel this year is the [Courtyard Minneapolis Downtown](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/mspdc-courtyard-minneapolis-downtown/), which has a complimentary shuttle to the McNamara Alumni Center venue.

Another great option for getting between the conference hotel and the venue would be the light rail Green Line, which stops about 100 ft from the hotel front door at West Bank Station and drops off about a 5 minute walk from McNamara at Stadium Village Station on the other side.

There is also the University Circulator, which is a bus that is free and open to the public. It picks up about a block from the hotel at Mondale Hall and drops off at McNamara.
