## When & Where

You can also check out a [sketch of our schedule](/program#our-schedule).

## Lodging
We have reserved a block of rooms at the [Graduate Minneapolis Hotel](https://www.graduatehotels.com/minneapolis/) at a base rate of $152 per night. To get the conference rate, please call 612-379-8888 and ask for the SRCCON rate, or use our [dedicated booking link](https://gc.synxis.com/rez.aspx?Hotel=76179&Chain=21643&template=RBE&shell=RBE&start=availresults&arrive=6%2f28%2f2018&depart=7%2f2%2f2018&adult=1&child=0&group=062718SRCC).

The Graduate Hotel is located directly next to the SRCCON venue and is connected by a tunnel in case of bad weather. The reserved block of rooms will be available until June 6 or all rooms are booked, whichever happens first—booking early is always at good idea!

## Childcare
We offer free, on-site childcare throughout the full SRCCON schedule (including Thursday evening) at the adjoining Graduate Hotel. The caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education. [Learn more about our free childcare now](/childcare).

## Transit
The [Minneapolis METRO system](http://www.metrotransit.org/metro-system) is an easy way to get around the city. You can ride light rail from the airport to the conference hotel for $1.75: Follow the light rail signs to the airport tram, which will take you right to the light rail station. Take the northbound ("Downtown Minneapolis") Blue Line to the Downtown East station, then cross to the other track to transfer to the eastbound Green Line. Take the Green Line two stops to East Bank. You’ll be looking right at [The Commons Hotel](http://www.commonshotel.com). The [McNamara Alumni Center](http://www.mac-events.org/) conference venue is another block past the hotel, on SE Oak Street.

## Parking
Transit in Minneapolis is great, but if you'll be driving, there's [a lot right near the McNamara Alumni Center](http://mac-events.org/directions/). We've reserved 30 spots per day for SRCCON attendees. Parking is $8/day. If you get to the ramp and it says "FULL" or "RESERVATION ONLY," just push "call for help" and tell them you're with SRCCON, and they'll let you in.

## Travel from outside the U.S.
For folks who are coming in from outside the U.S., we recommend [the EFF’s guide to protecting your data at the U.S. border](https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017) for details on what to consider at the border crossing. If you need any further help or have any questions, please [email us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).

## Food, Evenings, and More
We want you to be happy and well-fed at SRCCON, so we’re providing breakfast and lunch on both days, as well as a delicious dinner Thursday night. We’ll also have tea, coffee, and snacks—healthy and sugary—throughout the day, so stick around and enjoy the company of your fellow attendees.

On Thursday evening, [we'll have a slate of activities](/program/our-evening-program), and you can learn more about [the many ways to participate](/participation) in SRCCON, before, during, and after!
