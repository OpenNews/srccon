## Childcare
We offer free, on-site childcare throughout the full SRCCON schedule (including Thursday evening) at the adjoining Graduate Hotel. The caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education. [Learn more about our free childcare now](/childcare).

## Transit
The [Minneapolis METRO system](http://www.metrotransit.org/metro-system) is an easy way to get around the city. You can ride light rail from the airport to the conference hotel for $2: Follow the light rail signs to the airport tram, which will take you right to the light rail station. Take the northbound ("Downtown Minneapolis") Blue Line to the U.S. Bank Stadium station, then cross to the other track to transfer to the eastbound Green Line. Take the Green Line two stops to East Bank. You’ll be looking right at [The Graduate Hotel](https://www.graduatehotels.com/minneapolis/). The [McNamara Alumni Center](http://www.mac-events.org/) conference venue is another block past the hotel, on SE Oak Street.

## Parking
Transit in Minneapolis is great, but if you'll be driving, there's [a lot right near the McNamara Alumni Center](http://mac-events.org/directions/). Parking is $12/day.

## Travel from outside the U.S.
For folks who are coming in from outside the U.S., we recommend [the EFF’s guide to protecting your data at the U.S. border](https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017) for details on what to consider at the border crossing. If you need any further help or have any questions, please [email us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).

## Food, Evenings, and More
We want you to be happy and well-fed at SRCCON, so we’re providing breakfast and lunch on both days, as well as a delicious dinner Thursday night. We’ll also have tea, coffee, and snacks—healthy and sugary—throughout the day, so stick around and enjoy the company of your fellow attendees.

We'll have [a slate of activities on Thursday evening](/program/#our-evening-program), and you can learn more about [the many ways to participate](/participation) in SRCCON, before, during, and after the event!
