SRCCON 2017 takes place at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/mcnamara+alumni+center/@44.975251,-93.227871,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5f984f594ceab6ad?sa=X&ei=9qzmVISFC4iegwTskYDYCg&ved=0CIcBEPwSMBA">McNamara Alumni Center</a> on the University of Minnesota campus in Minneapolis.

## Lodging

We have reserved a block of rooms at the [The Commons Hotel](http://www.commonshotel.com) at a base rate of $153 per night. To get the conference rate, please call 612-379-8888 and ask for the SRCCON rate, or use our [dedicated booking link](https://gc.synxis.com/rez.aspx?Hotel=76179&Chain=21643&template=RBE&shell=RBE&start=availresults&arrive=8/1/2017&depart=8/6/2017&adult=1&child=0&group=080117SRCC).

SRCCON begins at 9am Thursday morning, Aug. 3, and will wrap up around 6pm Friday, Aug. 4. Many attendees plan to arrive on Wednesday and leave Friday night or Saturday morning. Community members sometimes plan related events around SRCCON as well, so if you want more time in Minneapolis, the conference rate is available Aug. 1-6.

The Commons Hotel is located directly next to the SRCCON venue and is connected by a tunnel in case of bad weather. The reserved block of rooms will be available until July 2 or all rooms are booked, whichever happens first—booking early is always a good idea!

## Transit
The [Minneapolis METRO system](http://www.metrotransit.org/metro-system) is an easy way to get around the city. You can ride light rail from the airport to the conference hotel for $1.75: Follow the light rail signs to the airport tram, which will take you right to the light rail station. Take the northbound ("Downtown Minneapolis") Blue Line to the Downtown East station, then cross to the other track to transfer to the eastbound Green Line. Take the Green Line two stops to East Bank. You’ll be looking right at [The Commons Hotel](http://www.commonshotel.com). The [McNamara Alumni Center](http://www.mac-events.org/) conference venue is another block past the hotel, on SE Oak Street.

## Meals at SRCCON
We want you to be happy and well-fed at SRCCON, so we're providing breakfast and lunch on both days, as well as a delicious dinner Thursday night. We'll also have tea, coffee, and snacks—healthy and sugary—throughout the day, so stick around and enjoy the company of your fellow attendees.

## Thursday evening at SRCCON
We know [evenings at conferences can be tough](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon-thursday/), so we schedule Thursday evening as an opportunity to have fun, relax, talk, and learn with colleagues and new friends. Thursday night is an opportunity to focus on the "life" side of the work/life balance. As part of that, we make a special Thursday evening ticket available for partners of SRCCON attendees.

## Childcare
We offer free, on-site childcare throughout the full SRCCON schedule (including Thursday evening) at the adjoining Commons Hotel. The caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education.
