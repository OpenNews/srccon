## Childcare
We are offering free, on-site childcare throughout the full SRCCON schedule (including Thursday evening) at the Marriott Courtyard Portland City Center via the astonishingly named but genuinely great [KiddieCorp](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/). The caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education. [Register your child now](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/srcconkids.htm), or [learn more about their staffing](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/staffselect.html) and [security procedures](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/security.html).

Staff-to-child ratios range from 1:2 for children 6-11 months to 1:7 for children aged 6-12 years, and KiddieCorp will work with SRCCON organizers to handle registration and logistics so your kid(s) can have a great time while you're conferencing nearby.

## Transit
Portland's [MAX Light Rail system](https://trimet.org/max/) is an easy way to get around the city. You can take the Red Line from the airport to the Oak/SW 1st Ave station for $2.50. That will drop you off about 4 blocks from the conference hotel.

## Meals at SRCCON
We want you to be happy and well-fed at SRCCON, so we're providing breakfast and lunch on both days, as well as a delicious dinner Thursday night. We'll also have tea, coffee, and snacks—healthy and sugary—throughout the day, so stick around and enjoy the company of your fellow attendees.

## Thursday Night at SRCCON
Thursday night, join us for SRCCON's evening fun: we'll be hosting games, lightning talks, and other activities. There will be local beverages and snacks, and much more. [Learn more and sign up now](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/SRCCON2016).

## Alcoholics Anonymous
