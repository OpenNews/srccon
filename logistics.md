SRCCON 2017 takes place at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/mcnamara+alumni+center/@44.975251,-93.227871,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5f984f594ceab6ad?sa=X&ei=9qzmVISFC4iegwTskYDYCg&ved=0CIcBEPwSMBA">McNamara Alumni Center</a> on the University of Minnesota campus in Minneapolis.

## Lodging
We will be making a special conference rate at [The Commons Hotel](http://www.commonshotel.com) available to ticketholders. The Commons Hotel is located directly next to the SRCCON venue and is connected by a tunnel in case of bad weather.

## Meals at SRCCON
We want you to be happy and well-fed at SRCCON, so we're providing breakfast and lunch on both days, as well as a delicious dinner Thursday night. We'll also have tea, coffee, and snacks—healthy and sugary—throughout the day, so stick around and enjoy the company of your fellow attendees.

## Thursday evening at SRCCON
We know [evenings at conferences can be tough](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon-thursday/), so we schedule Thursday evening as an opportunity to have fun, relax, talk, and learn with colleagues and new friends. Thursday night is an opportunity to focus on the "life" side of the work/life balance. As part of that, we make a special Thursday evening ticket available for partners of SRCCON attendees.   

## Childcare
We offer free, on-site childcare throughout the full SRCCON schedule (including Thursday evening) at the adjoining Commons Hotel. The caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education.

## More
There's a lot more to see and do at SRCCON and in Minneapolis and we'll be updating this page regularly as SRCCON approaches.
