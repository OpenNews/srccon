SRCCON 2015 takes place at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/mcnamara+alumni+center/@44.975251,-93.227871,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5f984f594ceab6ad?sa=X&ei=9qzmVISFC4iegwTskYDYCg&ved=0CIcBEPwSMBA">McNamara Alumni Center</a> on the University of Minnesota campus in Minneapolis.

## Schedule
The [full SRCCON schedule](http://schedule.srccon.org) is now live. SRCCON will run from 9am till 9pm on Thursday, June 25 (including breakfast and non-session evening activities), and from 10am till 6:15pm on Friday, June 26.

## Transit
<p>The <a href="http://www.metrotransit.org/metro-system">Minneapolis METRO system</a> is an easy way to get around the city. You can ride light rail from the airport to the conference hotel for $1.75: Follow the light rail signs to the airport tram, which will take you right to the light rail station. Take the northbound ("Downtown Minneapolis") Blue Line to the Downtown East station, then cross to the other track to transfer to the eastbound Green Line. Take the Green Line two stops to East Bank. You’ll be looking right at <a href="http://www.commonshotel.com/">The Commons Hotel</a>. The <a href="http://www.mac-events.org/">McNamara Alumni Center</a> conference venue is another block past the hotel, on SE Oak Street.</p>

## Meals at SRCCON
We want you to be happy and well-fed at SRCCON, so we're providing breakfast and lunch on both days, as well as a delicious dinner Thursday night. We'll also have tea, coffee, and snacks—healthy and sugary—throughout the day, so stick around and enjoy the company of your fellow attendees.

## Thursday Night at SRCCON
Thursday night, join us for SRCCON's evening fun: we'll be hosting games, lightning talks, a books share, a hack space, and more! There will be local beers available (and mini donuts!), and much more. [Learn more and sign up now](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/SRCCON2015).

## Alcoholics Anonymous
On Thursday night, the closest meeting to SRCCON is at [Drinkytown AA, University Lutheran Church of Hope 601 13th Av SE](https://www.google.com/maps/place/University+Lutheran+Church+of+Hope/@44.983557,-93.235761,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x7e2b9cb466a3fbda?sa=X&ei=4jiEVZyHMcbgoASy45voCQ&ved=0CG8Q_BIwCg), which meets Thursday at 6:30pm. It is an "open" meeting, meaning that you don't have to be alcoholic to go. AA Minneapolis also hosts a [full list of area meetings](http://www.aaminneapolis.org/pages/meeting/meetings.asp?Location=74&Name=Minneapolis%2C%20Southeast&Image=minneapolissoutheast.gif#Thursday).

The caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education. [Register your child now](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/srcconkids.htm), or [learn more about their staffing](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/staffselect.html) and [security procedures](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/security.html).

Staff-to-child ratios range from 1:2 for children 6-11 months to 1:7 for children aged 6-12 years, and KiddieCorp will work with SRCCON organizers to handle registration and logistics so your kid(s) can have a great time while you're conferencing next door.
