SRCCON 2016 takes place at the [Pacific Northwest College of Art](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pacific+Northwest+College+of+Art/@45.5269699,-122.6803404,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x549509fec32013d9:0x3ad790efffd31e44!8m2!3d45.5269699!4d-122.6781517), a beautifully restored and renovated 1918 building near downtown Portland, Oregon. Portland offers excellent restaurants, cafés, and breweries in a walkable, transit-friendly city, and easy day-trips include hiking around Mt. Hood and the gorgeous—and often sunny—Oregon coast. Over the next six weeks, we'll continue to publish lots of information to help you get the most out of your time at SRCCON and—for those who aren't local—explore the surrounding areas as well.

## Schedule
SRCCON will run from 9am till 10pm on Thursday, July 28 (including breakfast and non-session evening activities), and from 10am till 6pm on Friday, July 29. We'll publish a full session schedule in July!
