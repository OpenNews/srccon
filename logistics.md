<p class="big-lead">SRCCON 2018 takes place at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/mcnamara+alumni+center/@44.975251,-93.227871,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5f984f594ceab6ad?sa=X&ei=9qzmVISFC4iegwTskYDYCg&ved=0CIcBEPwSMBA">McNamara Alumni Center</a> on the University of Minnesota campus in Minneapolis.</p>

## Lodging
We have reserved a block of rooms at the [Graduate Minneapolis Hotel](https://www.graduatehotels.com/minneapolis/) at a base rate of $152 per night. To get the conference rate, please call 612-379-8888 and ask for the SRCCON rate, or use our [dedicated booking link](https://gc.synxis.com/rez.aspx?Hotel=76179&Chain=21643&template=RBE&shell=RBE&start=availresults&arrive=6%2f28%2f2018&depart=7%2f2%2f2018&adult=1&child=0&group=062718SRCC).

The Graduate Hotel is located directly next to the SRCCON venue and is connected by a tunnel in case of bad weather. The reserved block of rooms will be available until June 6 or all rooms are booked, whichever happens first—booking early is always at good idea!

## Room share
Have a room and looking for a roommate? Don't have a room and looking for someone who does? Add your info to [the room share list](https://etherpad.opennews.org/p/srcconRoomShare2018).

## Meals at SRCCON
We want you to be happy and well-fed at SRCCON, so we're providing breakfast and lunch on both days, as well as a delicious dinner Thursday night. We'll also have tea, coffee, and snacks—healthy and sugary—throughout the day, so stick around and enjoy the company of your fellow attendees.

## Thursday evening at SRCCON
We know [evenings at conferences can be tough](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon-thursday/), so we schedule Thursday evening as an opportunity to have fun, relax, talk, and learn with colleagues and new friends. Thursday night is an opportunity to focus on the "life" side of the work/life balance. We'll have more info about Thursday evening to share in the lead-up to SRCCON, plus we'll make a special Thursday evening ticket available for partners of SRCCON attendees.   

## Childcare
We offer free, on-site childcare throughout the full SRCCON schedule (including Thursday evening) at the adjoining Graduate Hotel. The caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education. [Learn more about our free childcare now](/childcare).

There's a lot more to see and do at SRCCON and in Minneapolis and we'll be updating this page regularly as SRCCON approaches.
