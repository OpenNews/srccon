## Venue and hotel directions
The conference hotel this year is the [Courtyard Minneapolis Downtown](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/mspdc-courtyard-minneapolis-downtown/), which is right near a stop on the light rail for easy travel from the airport and to the venue. 

There's a bunch of ways you can get to the conference venue from the hotel, which is a little over a mile away:

* **Complimentary Shuttle** the hotel itself provides a shuttle that's open to all guests from 7am-11pm daily, first-come, first-serve.
* **Transit** the light rail Green Line, stops about 100 ft from the hotel front door at West Bank Station and drops off about a 5 minute walk from McNamara at Stadium Village Station on the other side. This is a 2-minute ride, with 5 minutes of walking, and the train comes every 10 minutes.
* **University Circulator Shuttle** this bus is free and open to the public. It picks up about a block from the hotel at Mondale Hall and drops off at McNamara. It runs every 15 minutes from 7am-9:30pm.
* **Walking** the walk is just about half an hour, as outlined in [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/T5R7ecE4Vsvqq2Wj8). The descriptive version is: Exit the hotel and head east on S Washington Ave which will turn into S 2nd Street as you pass 19th Ave. In about 150ft, just before the parking lot, you'll turn right onto the sidewalk path, cutting through campus. Continue on the sidewalk east/southeast, around the University of MN Law School Building, until you see the Washington Ave Bridge. There is a walking/biking side of this bridge, and you'll use this to head across the river to the East Bank campus. After exiting the bridge, continue east on Washington Ave for 1/4 of a mile. McNamara Alumni Center will be on your left, between Walnut and Oak.
