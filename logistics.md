SRCCON 2017 takes place at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/mcnamara+alumni+center/@44.975251,-93.227871,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5f984f594ceab6ad?sa=X&ei=9qzmVISFC4iegwTskYDYCg&ved=0CIcBEPwSMBA">McNamara Alumni Center</a> on the University of Minnesota campus in Minneapolis.

## Preparing for SRCCON
In addition to this page with all the logistical details you may need as you prep for SRCCON, we wanted to make sure you know what to expect at the conference. Take a look at our new [SRCCON Participant Guide](/guide/participant/). It's our best guess at the questions you may have.

## Getting to SRCCON
If you're still looking to make your lodging arrangements, we've got [a list of nearby hotels](#lodging) and a [roomshare list](#room-share). For getting to the venue, you can also check out [transit](#transit) and [parking](#parking) details. If you're attending from outside the U.S., [we have a recommended resource](#travel-from-outside-the-us) for what to consider at the U.S. border crossing.

## During SRCCON
We've tried to think of everything you might need, from [hearty, tasty meals](#meals-at-srccon) to [childcare](#childcare). You can check out [the full schedule now](http://schedule.srccon.org/) (it's mobile friendly too!). When you arrive at the venue, we'll also have on-the-spot signups to host conversations about the "life" side of work/life balance on Thursday evening, and the "work" side during Friday lunch.

Throughout SRCCON, we'll also have office hours (new this year) and a big job board for any positions you'd like to post. We'll have a signup sheet for the office hours, where you can block out an hour to chat one-on-one with participants about a project you're working on or maybe a position you're hiring for. We'll have post-its at the ready for your job posting needs as well.

Thursday evening, we'll feed you dinner and [have three hours of fun planned](#thursday-evening-at-srccon), and you can even [bring your partner](#thursday-evening-bring-your-partners) to join you. We've also gathered details about a local [Alcoholics Anonymous meeting](#alcoholics-anonymous), and your fellow news nerds have written an enormous [guide to the Twin Cities](#more-to-doeatdrinkseedance-to).

Also, the entirety of SRCCON is covered by our [code of conduct](/conduct).

# All of the logistics

## Meals at SRCCON
We want you to be happy and well-fed at SRCCON, so we're providing breakfast and lunch on both days, as well as a delicious dinner Thursday night. We'll also have tea, coffee, and snacks—healthy and sugary, both—throughout the day, so stick around and enjoy the company of your fellow attendees.

## Thursday evening at SRCCON
We know [evenings at conferences can be tough](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon-thursday/), so we schedule Thursday evening as an opportunity to have fun, talk, and relax with colleagues and new friends. You might end up learning a new skill or two as well, but we try to focus the evening program on the "life" side of the work/life balance.

We'll keep feeding you, too—there'll be awesome local snacks, beer and wine, and plenty of great nonalcoholic beverages. After dinner on Thursday, the evening program will spread throughout the SRCCON venue for things like:

* board games ([bring one you'd like to teach people to play!](https://etherpad.opennews.org/p/BoardGames))
* lightning talks
* a guided walk through Minneapolis with a local expert
* conversations about things you love (we'll schedule rooms for these and post a signup sheet at SRCCON)
* hobby workshops

## Thursday evening, bring your partners
If you have partners or friends who will be in Minneapolis, feel free to invite them to join the Thursday evening fun. We're happy to welcome them for Thursday evening's dinner and activities, with a special <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/srccon-2017-partner-ticket-tickets-36309639108">$45 partner ticket that you can purchase now</a>.

## More to Do/Eat/Drink/See/Dance To
If you're looking for things to before, after, or during SRCCON, we have [compiled a guide to wonderful things in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area](/guide/index.html), written by local news nerds.

## Alcoholics Anonymous
On Thursday night, the closest meeting to SRCCON is at Drinkytown AA, [University Lutheran Church of Hope 601 13th Av SE](https://www.google.com/maps/place/University+Lutheran+Church+of+Hope/@44.983557,-93.235761,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x7e2b9cb466a3fbda?sa=X&ei=4jiEVZyHMcbgoASy45voCQ&ved=0CG8Q_BIwCg), which meets Thursday at 6:30pm. It is an "open" meeting, meaning that you don't have to be alcoholic to go. AA Minneapolis also [hosts a full list of area meetings](http://www.aaminneapolis.org/pages/meeting/meetings.asp?Location=74&Name=Minneapolis%2C%20Southeast&Image=minneapolissoutheast.gif#Thursday).

## Childcare
We offer free, on-site childcare throughout the full SRCCON schedule (including Thursday evening) at the adjoining Commons Hotel. The caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education. [Learn more about our free childcare.](/childcare)

## Travel from outside the U.S.

For folks who are coming in from outside the U.S., we recommend the EFF’s [guide to protecting your data at the US border](https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017) for details on what to consider at the border crossing. If you need any further help or have any questions, please [email us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).

Have a room and looking for a roommate? Don’t have a room and looking for someone who does? Add your info to the [room share list](https://etherpad.opennews.org/p/srcconRoomShare2017).

## Transit
The [Minneapolis METRO system](http://www.metrotransit.org/metro-system) is an easy way to get around the city. You can ride light rail from the airport to the conference hotel for $1.75: Follow the light rail signs to the airport tram, which will take you right to the light rail station. Take the northbound ("Downtown Minneapolis") Blue Line to the Downtown East station, then cross to the other track to transfer to the eastbound Green Line. Take the Green Line two stops to East Bank. You’ll be looking right at [The Commons Hotel](http://www.commonshotel.com). The [McNamara Alumni Center](http://www.mac-events.org/) conference venue is another block past the hotel, on SE Oak Street.

## Parking
Transit in Minneapolis is great, but if you'll be driving, there's [a lot right near the McNamara Alumni Center](http://mac-events.org/directions/). We've reserved 30 spots per day for SRCCON attendees. Parking is $8/day. If you get to the ramp and it says "FULL" or "RESERVATION ONLY," just push "call for help" and tell them you're with SRCCON, and they'll let you in.
