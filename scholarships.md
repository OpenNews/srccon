<p class="bodybig">If you want to attend SRCCON, we don&rsquo;t want cost to prevent you from coming, which is why we work to keep ticket prices low. To help defray the cost of attending SRCCON, OpenNews offers a limited number of travel scholarships.</p>

Whether you&rsquo;re a newsroom developer at a small organization with a strained professional development budget or a freelance developer eager to learn more about journalism code, we want to help you attend SRCCON. And new this year, you do not have to fill out a separate application to apply. Scholarship questions will be part of both the call for proposals form and the ticket lottery signup form.

### What we&rsquo;re offering
A ticket to SRCCON and $500 for you to use toward the cost of travel to the event. (For scholarship recipients who live in the Minneapolis area, we offer a SRCCON ticket without the additional travel funding.)

### Who should apply
* Anyone who is part of the journalism code community
* Anyone interested in learning more about the journalism code community
* People of color, women, and other under-represented groups in technology are strongly encouraged to apply

### How to apply
Select the "Would you like to be considered for a SRCCON scholarship?" option on the application to propose a session or on the ticket lottery sign up form. A few scholarship-specific questions will then pop onto the form.

### When notifications go out
Notifications for scholarships will go out alongisde notifications related to session proposals and the ticket lottery. 

### What happens after SRCCON
You tell us how it went! We&rsquo;ll send you a short follow up survey and will be excited to check out any blog posts or code repos that come out of your participation at SRCCON.

### Why are you offering this scholarship?
We want to make sure that SRCCON is an event that includes the diversity of the communities we serve&mdash;geographically, demographically, experientially, and more. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that.

### How do you decide who will receive a scholarship?
OpenNews staff reviews all applications. We prioritize applications from members of communities under-represented in journalism and technology and from smaller and non-coastal newsrooms.

### Do I still need to purchase a ticket to SRCCON?
If you receive a scholarship, you will not have to purchase a ticket. 

### When will I receive my scholarship?
When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship funds. In short, you will need to send us an invoice and our administrators will process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.

### What if I need more than $500 for my travel?
We're able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. Luckily, Minneapolis is a relatively cheap city once you arrive. Also, this entire site is a [GitHub pages repo](https://github.com/OpenNews/srccon), so if you say, wanted to add a link to a room-share board, you could go right ahead and do that. Or, you can [email with any suggestions](erika@opennews.org).
