title: SRCCON 2019 — Scholarships
---

<p class="big-lead">We don&rsquo;t want cost to prevent you from coming to SRCCON, which is why we work to keep ticket prices low. To help defray the cost of attending, OpenNews offers a limited number of travel scholarships.</p>

# Scholarships for SRCCON 2019

Whether you&rsquo;re a newsroom developer at a small organization with a strained professional development budget or a freelance developer eager to learn more about journalism code, we want to help you attend SRCCON.

There's no separate application—there were questions about scholarships on [our call for participation form](/participation/form/), which closed for scholarship applications on April 24.

## What We&rsquo;re Offering

A ticket to SRCCON and $500 for you to use toward the cost of travel to the event. (For scholarship recipients who live in the Minneapolis area, we offer a SRCCON ticket without the additional travel funding.)

In addition to the travel scholarships, for the first time this year, we're offering one scholarship of $500 for caretaking-related costs. (Either to bring your loved ones to Minneapolis, or help care for them back home while you're at the conference.) There is a separate question on the call for participation form to apply for this scholarship.

## Who Should Apply

* Anyone who is part of the journalism code community
* Anyone interested in learning more about the journalism code community
* People of color, women, and other underrepresented groups in technology are strongly encouraged to apply

## How to Apply
The application was part of our [call for participation form](/participation/form/). The deadline to apply for a scholarship was April 24.

## When Notifications Go Out
Notifications for scholarships will go out alongside other notifications as part of the call for participation. You'll hear from us by May 10.

## What Happens After SRCCON
You tell us how it went! We&rsquo;ll send you a short followup survey and will be excited to check out anything you write or build coming out of your participation at SRCCON.

## Why Are You Offering This Scholarship?
We want to make sure that SRCCON is an event that includes the diversity of the communities we serve&mdash;geographically, demographically, experientially, and more. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that.

## How Do You Decide Who Will Receive a Scholarship?
OpenNews staff reviews all applications. We prioritize applications from members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology and from smaller and non-coastal newsrooms.

## Do I Still Need to Purchase a Ticket to SRCCON?
If you receive a scholarship, you will not have to purchase a ticket.

## When Will I Receive My Scholarship?
When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship funds. In short, you will need to fill out a form and send some tax paperwork for our administrators to process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.

## What If I Need More Than $500 for My Travel?
We're able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. Luckily, Minneapolis is a relatively cheap city once you arrive. Also, this entire site runs [off a Github repo](https://github.com/OpenNews/srccon), so if you, say, wanted to add a link to a room-share board, you could go right ahead and do that! Or, you can [email with any suggestions](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).
