<p class="big-lead">We don&rsquo;t want cost to prevent you from coming to SRCCON, which is why we work to keep ticket prices low. To help defray the cost of attending SRCCON, OpenNews offers a limited number of travel scholarships.</p>

# Scholarships for SRCCON 2018

Whether you&rsquo;re a newsroom developer at a small organization with a strained professional development budget or a freelance developer eager to learn more about journalism code, we want to help you attend SRCCON.

You do not have to fill out a separate application to apply. Scholarship questions are part of our call for participation form, which closed on April 20.

## What We&rsquo;re Offering
A ticket to SRCCON and $500 for you to use toward the cost of travel to the event. (For scholarship recipients who live in the Minneapolis area, we offer a SRCCON ticket without the additional travel funding.)

## Who Should Apply
* Anyone who is part of the journalism code community
* Anyone interested in learning more about the journalism code community
* People of color, women, and other under-represented groups in technology are strongly encouraged to apply

## How to Apply
The application closed on April 20. When it was open, you could select the "Would you like to be considered for a SRCCON scholarship?" option on the application call for participation form. A few scholarship-specific questions will pop onto the form.

## When Notifications Go Out
Notifications for scholarships will go out alongisde other notifications as part of the call for participation. Everyone will hear back by April 30.

## What Happens After SRCCON
You tell us how it went! We&rsquo;ll send you a short followup survey and will be excited to check out any blog posts or code repos that come out of your participation at SRCCON.

## Why Are You Offering This Scholarship?
We want to make sure that SRCCON is an event that includes the diversity of the communities we serve&mdash;geographically, demographically, experientially, and more. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that.

## How Do You Decide Who Will Receive a Scholarship?
OpenNews staff reviews all applications. We prioritize applications from members of communities under-represented in journalism and technology and from smaller and non-coastal newsrooms.

## Do I Still Need to Purchase a Ticket to SRCCON?
If you receive a scholarship, you will not have to purchase a ticket.

## When Will I Receive My Scholarship?
When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship funds. In short, you will need to fill out a form and send some tax paperwork for our administrators to process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.

## What If I Need More Than $500 for My Travel?
We're able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. Luckily, Minneapolis is a relatively cheap city once you arrive. Also, this entire site runs [off a Github repo](https://github.com/OpenNews/srccon), so if you say, wanted to add a link to a room-share board, you could go right ahead and do that. Or, you can [email with any suggestions](mailto:erika@opennews.org).
