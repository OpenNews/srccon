<div class="page-divider"><span>About SRCCON:‚ù§Ô∏è</span></div>

At the end of 2020, we want to take time to _be_ with each other and share what has gotten us through this year, immersed in joy, sadness, power, possibility, and love. [At SRCCON in July](https://opennews.org//blog/less-alone-srccon), we heard how important it is to just be in each other's company, to create space to "feel like I can dream again." So we're going to close down the year with some time to party, reflect, relax, and catch up with each other. 

Join us for a day of activities and celebration of YOU, the people who lead and sustain this work. As always, the program will be collaborative, created and led by community members. We expect the program will take place from 12-4pm ET that day (replacing our usual [community call](https://opennews.org/what/community/calls) with this special event!). We'll confirm further details and the registration process in early December.


<div id="tickets" class="page-divider"><span>Tickets & attending</span></div>

<div class="page-divider"><span>What you can expect</span></div>

We want this event to be a moment for rest, in recognition of the year we've been through, what we've learned about ourselves and about being there for each other. A little community retreat! With snacks and drinks (and maybe even crafts?) encouraged! At SRCCON:‚ù§Ô∏è you'll:

* find small groups to laugh and talk with about hobbies, arts, and other things that sustain you outside of work, plus join everyone in sharing some shine for the people who keep inspiring us
* reconnect with old friends and run into new ones, strengthening the personal relationships that knit together a network that's reimagining journalism
* bring who you are into an event designed to celebrate all of it, along with everyone ready to take on 2021 alongside you
