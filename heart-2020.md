<div class="page-divider"><span>About SRCCON:❤️</span></div>

At the end of 2020, we want to take time to _be_ with each other and share what has gotten us through this year, immersed in joy, sadness, power, possibility, and love. [At SRCCON in July](https://opennews.org//blog/less-alone-srccon), we heard how important it is to just be in each other's company, to create space to "feel like I can dream again." So we're going to close down the year with some time to party, reflect, relax, and catch up with each other. 

Join us for a day of activities and celebration of YOU, the people who lead and sustain this work. As always, the program will be collaborative, created and led by community members. We expect the program will take place from 12-4pm ET that day (replacing our usual [community call](https://opennews.org/what/community/calls) with this special event!). We'll confirm further details and the registration process in early December.


<div class="page-divider"><span>Tickets & attending</span></div>

Tickets for SRCCON:❤️ are free for [OpenNews Sustainers](https://opennews.networkforgood.com/) and will also be available on a sliding scale. (Find out [more about becoming an OpenNews sustainer](https://opennews.org/blog/lead-launch-sustainer/), the incredible group of donors who have made a recurring commitment to this work.) If you would like to attend but are unable to sign up as a sustainer at this time, five community members have pledged to support new members in joining. [Reach out to us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) and we'll take care of the rest.
