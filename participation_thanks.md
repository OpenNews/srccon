# Thank You for Answering the SRCCON 2018 Call for Participation!

If you proposed a session idea, we'll be reading it through soon and then publish it on the SRCCON website. And if you let us know about some other way you'd like to participate at SRCCON 2018, or you asked about scholarships, we'll follow up with you soon!

Do you have a colleague who would be interested in or benefit from joining us in Minneapolis on June 28 & 29? Please ask them to apply! We hugely appreciate help reaching beyond our own networks, and personal recommendations have been a major part of what helps new folks find out about our events and bring more people into the community.

Between now and then, here are a couple of key dates in the SRCCON process:

* The call for participation closes **Friday, April 13, at 11:59pm ET**.
* We'll notify everyone about attendance (and session proposals, if you submitted one) by **Monday, April 30**.

**Reminder to session proposers:** Because SRCCON is a collaborative, peer-to-peer event, rather than a series of prepared conference talks, we ask that all participants buy a ticket. We'll reserve a ticket for purchase by facilitators of accepted sessions.

And you can also send any additional session proposals to us at [srccon@opennews.org](mailto:srccon@opennews.org)â€”no need to fill out the form a second time.
