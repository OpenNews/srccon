# Thank You for Answering the SRCCON 2019 Call for Participation!

We're excited to hear you'd like to be at SRCCON, and we’ll follow up with you soon!

Do you have a colleague who would be interested in or benefit from joining us in Minneapolis on July 11 & 12? Please ask them to apply! We hugely appreciate help reaching beyond our own networks, and personal recommendations are one of the best ways to help new folks find out about our events and bring more people into the community.

Between now and then, here are a couple of key dates in the SRCCON process:

* The call for participation closes Wednesday, April 24, at 11:59pm ET.
* We'll notify everyone about attendance (and session proposals and scholarship applications, if you submitted one) by Friday, May 10.

**Reminder to session proposers:** Because SRCCON is a collaborative, peer-to-peer event rather than a series of prepared conference talks, we ask that all participants [buy a ticket](/participation/#a-new-approach-to-ticket-prices). We'll reserve a ticket for purchase by facilitators of accepted sessions.

And you can also send any additional session proposals to us at [srccon@opennews.org](mailto:srccon@opnnews.org)—no need to fill out the form a second time.
