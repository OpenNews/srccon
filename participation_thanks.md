# Thank You for Answering the SRCCON 2018 Call for Participation!

Thanks for letting us know you'd like to be at SRCCON. We’ll follow up with you soon!

Do you have a colleague who would be interested in or benefit from joining us in Minneapolis on June 28 & 29? Please ask them to apply! We hugely appreciate help reaching beyond our own networks, and personal recommendations have been a major part of what helps new folks find out about our events and bring more people into the community.

Between now and then, here are a couple of key dates in the SRCCON process:

* The call for participation for attendees closes Friday, April 20, at 5pm ET.
* We’ll notify everyone about attendance (and session proposals) by Monday, April 30.
