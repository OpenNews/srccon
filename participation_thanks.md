# Thank You for Answering the SRCCON 2018 Call for Participation!

Thanks for letting us know you'd like to be at SRCCON. Weâ€™ll follow up with you soon!

Do you have a colleague who would be interested in or benefit from joining us in Minneapolis on June 28 & 29? Please ask them to apply! We hugely appreciate help reaching beyond our own networks, and personal recommendations have been a major part of what helps new folks find out about our events and bring more people into the community.

You will hear back from us about your application within a few days. We're going to review applications on a set rolling schedule:

* Applications submitted Monday-Tuesday will be notified on Wednesday and have by noon ET Friday to purchase their ticket
* Applications submitted Wednesday-Thursday will be notified on Friday and will have by noon ET Monday to purchase their ticket
* Applications submitted Friday-Sunday will be notified on Monday and will have by noon ET on Wednesday to purchase their ticket

If you need more time than that to purchase your ticket, you can just let us know, but we're setting this schedule out in advance to help folks plan around it.
