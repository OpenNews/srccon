## Frequently Asked Questions
### Why are you offering this scholarship?
We want to make sure that SRCCON is an event that includes the diversity of the communities we serve--geographically, demographically, experentially, and more. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that.

### How do you decide who will receive a scholarship?
OpenNews staff will review the applications. We will prioritize applications from people under-represented in the journalism code community as well as from people who would be unable to attend the event without the scholarship.

### Do I still need to purchase a ticket to SRCCON?
Yes, everyone attending SRCCON needs to [purchase a ticket](/register). If you are able to purchase your ticket before hearing back about the scholarship, please do. We will hold back a small number of tickets for people to purchase upon receiving the scholarship.

### When will I hear if I will receive a scholarship?
We will notify all scholarship applicants on June 18.

### When will I receive my scholarship?
When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship. You will need to send us an invoice and our administrators will process the payment. It may take a month or so for the money to make its way to your bank account.

### What if I need more than $500 for my travel?
Unfortunately, we are only able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. This is our first time offering these scholarships, so we needed to start with a simple set-up, but we appreciate [any feedback](erika@mozillafoundation.org) on the process.

### What are other ways I can cover the cost of my travel?
Luckily, Philadelphia is a relatively cheap city once you arrive. There is a hostel around the corner from the venue, and many other cheap accommodations and food options. Also, this entire site is a [github pages repo](https://github.com/sinker/srccon), so if you say, wanted to add a link to a room-share board, you could go right ahead and do that. Or, you can [email](erika@mozillafoundation.org) with any suggestions.
