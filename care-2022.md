<div class="page-divider"><span>About SRCCON:CARE</span></div>

Join us for a chance to slow down and reflect on caring as a practice. Through two days of hands-on sessions and emergent conversations, we'll delve into how that practice shows up in caring for each other as journalists and caring for our communities through the ways in which we create and disseminate journalism. We'll discuss what we can learn from other fields and how we can set up our organizations to live out values of care.

Our hope is that creating a space for rest and care will also open up room for joy, imagination, inspiration, and transformative ideas for journalism. In closing, we'll aim for every participant to walk away with a plan to build from these conversations, whether it be implementing an aspect of caring practice or making more space for joy or rest. Let us know how you'd like to participate.


<div class="page-divider"><span>When & where</span></div>

December 8-9, online


<div class="page-divider"><span>Participating in SRCCON:CARE</span></div>

Our call for participation will be open **October 11-25** for your session proposal ideas. 

We are looking for sessions that help explore the idea of caring as a practice: how it informs coverage, how our teams function, and how we take care of ourselves too. We're excited for session ideas about the ways caring shows up for you—in work and outside of it!

In addition to sharing session proposal ideas, the call for participation form is a place to let us know you'd like to be a part of SRCCON:CARE! As a hands-on conference, everyone who attends actively participates and the feedback you share in the form helps us understand what you would like to see on the schedule and how you'd like to connect with others at the event. 


<div id="tickets" class="page-divider"><span>Tickets & attending</span></div>

Ticket prices will start at $75, plus ticketing fees. We'll also offer a limited number of need-based, free scholarship tickets as well as $200 stipends for attendees whose time to attend would otherwise be uncompensated. To purchase a ticket, you'll first need to fill out the call for participation, and then we'll send a link to pick up your ticket. 

This event will take place largely on Zoom, and we're exploring other ways to help participants connect as well. The entire event will be [covered under our code of conduct. The program will take place over a chunk of hours both days, with ample breaks and an attempt to keep things accessible for a range of time zones. 

During SRCCON:CARE you can expect to:

* Be part of hands-on workshops that reimagine care as a practice in journalism —not panels where you sit back and listen, but sessions where you participate and learn from the wisdom of everyone in the room.
* Connect with people who share your hopes and dreams for journalism—not just making professional acquaintances, but creating personal relationships that last.
* Bring who you are into a conference that thinks about the program, the schedule—even hobbies & meals—as ways to celebrate everything you have to share.

We're really excited about this chance to spend two days immersed in thinking and doing of care. If you have any questions about what to expect, please [reach out to us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).
