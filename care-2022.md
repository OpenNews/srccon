### Thank you, SRCCON:CARE

We've wrapped up this event, but you can still [check out our program, all about care as a practice in journalism](/srccon-care-2022/program#our-schedule).

<div class="page-divider" id="about"><span>About our program</span></div>

#### The Program (Thursday-Friday, December 8-9)

* **Sessions:** Each day we'll host two, one-hour long participatory sessions that explore the practice of care in journalism. Community members will facilitate peer conversations and hands-on workshops that draw on the experience of every attendee in the (Zoom) room.
* **Social space:** We'll have half hour social breaks each day to continue the conversation in the session or head into the conference Slack to catch up.
* **Group gatherings:** We'll open the conference on Thursday and close on Friday with activities for the whole audience to help guide our time together and identify our collective next steps.


#### The SRCCON Slack (Tuesday-Tuesday, December 6-13)

Every SRCCON is a community. Our weeklong event Slack is a space to meet other attendees, share and discover projects, keep talking about sessions, and find emergent conversations. And when SRCCON is over, we'll gather up links and trade contact info, then sign out till next year.

<div class="page-divider" id="about"><span>About SRCCON:CARE</span></div>

Join us for a chance to slow down and reflect on caring as a practice. Through two days of [hands-on sessions and emergent conversations](/srccon-care-2022/program/), we'll delve into how that practice shows up in caring for each other as journalists and caring for our communities through the ways in which we create and disseminate journalism. We'll discuss what we can learn from other fields and how we can set up our organizations to live out values of care.

Our hope is that creating a space for rest and care will also open up room for joy, imagination, inspiration, and transformative ideas for journalism. In closing, we'll aim for every participant to walk away with a plan to build from these conversations, whether it be implementing an aspect of caring practice or making more space for joy or rest. [Let us know how you'd like to participate](/care/participation/form).

Check out the [list of accepted sessions and schedule for December 8-9](/srccon-care-2022/program/).

<div id="tickets" class="page-divider"><span>Tickets & attending</span></div>

Ticket prices will start at $75, plus ticketing fees. We'll also offer a limited number of need-based, free scholarship tickets as well as $200 stipends for attendees whose time to attend would otherwise be uncompensated. To purchase a ticket, you'll first need to [fill out the call for participation](/care/participation/form), and then we'll send a link to pick up your ticket. 

This event will take place largely on Zoom, and we're exploring other ways to help participants connect as well. The entire event will be [covered under our code of conduct](/conduct).

During SRCCON:CARE you can expect to:

* Be part of hands-on workshops that reimagine care as a practice in journalism—not panels where you sit back and listen, but sessions where you participate and learn from the wisdom of everyone in the room.
* Connect with people who share your hopes and dreams for journalism—not just making professional acquaintances, but creating personal relationships that last.
* Bring who you are into a conference that thinks about the program, the schedule—even hobbies & meals—as ways to celebrate everything you have to share.

We're really excited about this chance to spend two days immersed in thinking and doing of care. If you have any questions about what to expect, please [reach out to us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).
