This year, as we planned out the opening session for our third SRCCON, we realized that the number of useful, important details we needed to communicate had grown beyond what a welcome session could reasonably include. We therefore offer our first-ever brief guide to SRCCON, including all the tricks and details you need to have the best and most enjoyable time attending.

## The Schedule

* The SRCCON schedule lives at [schedule.srccon.org](http://schedule.srccon.org)—there is no printed version, so load that link on your phone.
* SRCCON was inspired by wonderful hallway conversations at other events,  so there are big spacious breaks between sessions so that you can actually talk to people—take advantage of them.
* There will be a lot of food available to you over the next two days—meals, snacks, our coffee & tea hacking station, and more, so you don't need to worry about the timing or location of your next food or caffeine.
* The long lunch breaks on both days will include topical Lunch Conversations—and you can sign up at the registration desk to lead one on Friday, if you're interested.
* Thursday evening we've scheduled lightning talks, walks, games, non-work talks and skillshares, and other informal sessions.

## Sessions

* Sessions are built for active participation, so you'll have the best experience if you show up willing to (even very quietly) jump in and contribute.
* About half of all sessions will be transcribed by our amazing live-captioning team, and some sessions will be audio-recorded. You can get alerts when each transcription begins streaming live by following [@srccon](https://twitter.com/srccon)  or installing our [SRCCON Transcript Alert Slack bot](http://srccon.org/slackbot/).

## Registration

* To register, walk through the main entrance of the PNCA building (facing the post office), past the security desk—you won't need to sign in—to the registration desk in the building's sunny atrium.
* When you register, you can choose a badge lanyard indicating your photo preferences (green = photos fine; yellow = ask first; red = no photos) and, if you like, a pin for your lanyard to communicate your preferred pronouns.

## Safety & conduct

* If we had to state our hopes and expectations for everyone at SRCCON in one sentence, it would go something like "please take care with each other and watch out for your fellow participants."
* Since we don't have to stick to one sentence, our [code of conduct](http://srccon.org/conduct/) sets out our expectations in greater detail, and we hope you'll take a look.
* If you need to report a problem or need assistance during the conference, please text or call SRC CON 2909 (772-266-2909) and we'll do all we can to help.

## The venue

* Our conference venue is an art school with exhibitions going on and summer classes in session, so please be respectful of classes in progress and take care with the venue's many art installations.
*  The building's long history—and beautiful restoration—has resulted in some complicated wayfinding needs. Our sessions take place on three floors, and you'll find maps on the walls—the pink X marks your spot—and plentiful volunteers to help you find your way.
* There's a gender-neutral bathroom on the building's first floor—check any posted map for details.

## More

* Our offical videographer will be moving through the conference both days—rest assured that your lanyard photo preferences will be respected, and he won't be recording audio, so your conversations are safe.
* Our official hashtag is [#SRCCON](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23srccon&src=typd).
