<h2>More Tickets On Sale June 19</h2>

<p>Due to the intense interest in SRCCON, we found a few ways to slightly expand the event capacity and open up more seats.
<ul>
<li>We have held tickets for people whose session proposals are accepted, but who haven&rsquo;t yet registered. Those folks will be notified on June 13 and will have three days to complete registration. (If you have pitched a session and plan to be out of contact on those dates, <a href="mailto:srccon@opennews.org">please let us know</a>.)

<li>After that, the remaining tickets will go on open sale June 19.

<li><a href="/sponsors">Sponsoring organizations</a> will receive between one and four complimentary tickets at the $1,000 level and above.

<li>Attendees who receive a <a href="/scholarships">travel scholarship</a> and have not yet purchased a ticket will have the opportunity to do so in late June. The deadline for to apply for the $500 travel scholarships is Friday, June 13. (This will be a very limited number of tickets—please don&rsquo;t apply for a travel scholarship as a way to get a ticket.)
</ul>
<p>The demand for SRCCON tickets took us by surprise, but it shouldn&rsquo;t have—it&rsquo;s a reflection of the eagerness of this community to spend focused time together planning and building. SRCCON is by design a community-driven event, and we&rsquo;re committed to ensuring that it is accessible, welcoming, and reflects the diversity of the communities we serve.

<p>Thank you for your support, patience, and excitement.
