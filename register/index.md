<h2>WE SOLD OUT</h2>
<p>SRCCON tickets sold out significantly faster than we'd expected today, and we're honestly a bit overwhelmed. We're so sorry that not everyone who wants to come was able to buy a ticket, and are seeing what we can do to increase capacity.

<p>We are more grateful than we can say for your support and  patience, and we love you all.

<p>We'll provide updates as soon as we can. If we're able to open up more tickets, we'll let you know with **plenty** of warning through <a href="http://twitter.com/srccon">@srccon</a> and our <a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/subscribe/">email list</a>.

We know that things went very fast. If you have any questions about whether your order went through, [please email us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).

We offer a small number of $500 travel scholarships to attendees for whom the cost to attend would otherwise be prohibitive. [Travel scholarship applications are open](/scholarships).
