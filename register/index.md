<h2>SRCCON is sold out!</h2>
<p>Due to the intense interest in SRCCON, we found a few ways to slightly expand the event capacity and open up more seats. We have offered tickets to everyone on the initial wait list, to the leaders of accepted sessions, and to travel scholarship recipients. The remaining pool of tickets has now sold out, and we thank you for your support, patience, and excitement.</p>

<p>If you missed tickets, we&rsquo;ll be back next year with SRCCON II.</p>
