<h2>More Tickets Coming Soon</h2>

<p>Due to intense interest in SRCCON, we've found a few ways to slightly expand the event capacity and open up more seats. We've already welcomed in the folks who made it onto the wait list Friday, and here's how remaining tickets will be distributed:
<ul>
<li>We will hold tickets for people whose session proposals are accepted, but who haven't yet registered. <a href="/sessions/pitch">Session pitches</a> are open until June 9 and folks who have their sessions approved will be notified June 13. Those people will have three days to complete registration. (If you are pitching a session and plan to be out of contact on those dates, please let us know beforehand.)

<li>After that, the remaining tickets will go on open sale June 19.

<li><a href="/sponsors">Sponsoring organizations</a> will receive between one and four complimentary tickets at the $1,000 level and above.

<li>Attendees who receive a <a href="/scholarships">travel scholarship</a> and have not yet purchased a ticket will have the opportunity to do so in late June. (This will be a very limited number of tickets—please don't apply for a travel scholarship as a way to get a ticket.)
</ul>
<p>The demand for SRCCON tickets took us by surprise, but it shouldn't have—it's a reflection of the eagerness of this community to spend focused time together planning and building. SRCCON is by design a community-driven event, and we're committed to ensuring that it is accessible, welcoming, and reflects the diversity of the communities we serve.

<p>Thank you for your support, patience, and excitement.

We know that things went very fast. If you have any questions about whether your order went through, [please email us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).

We offer a small number of $500 travel scholarships to attendees for whom the cost to attend would otherwise be prohibitive. [Travel scholarship applications are open](/scholarships).
