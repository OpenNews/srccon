<p class="bodybig">Registration to SRCCON opens May 30, and tickets will be available on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

SRCCON is a small event, and we anticipate releasing no more than 125 tickets, so if you're planning to attend, you may want to [join our notifications list](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/subscribe/) or follow Source on Twitter to get a notification when they go on sale. Tickets will cost $150, and all attendees will need to purchase a ticket, including session leaders. Registration will cover your entry to the two-day conference, a couple of meals per day, plus snacks. 

OpenNews will offer a small number of $500 travel scholarships to attendees for whom the cost to attend would otherwise be prohibitive. We will post a brief application form when registration launches. If you have any questions, please [email us](mailto:source@mozillafoundation.org).

We also have a community-wide request: if you know someone who loves to code and is interested in journalism and related work and you think they might enjoy SRCCON, please take a moment to send them to our site or [make an introduction](mailto:source@mozillafoundation.org), especially if you think they might not hear about it otherwise.
