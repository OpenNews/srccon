<p class="bodybig">Registration to SRCCON opens May 31, and tickets will be available on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

SRCCON is a small event. We anticipate releasing no more than 125 tickets, so if you&rsquo;re planning to attend, you may want to [join our notifications list] or [follow Source on Twitter](http://twitter.com/source) to get a notification when they go on sale. Tickets will cost $150, and all attendees will need to purchase a ticket, including session leaders.

OpenNews will offer a small number of $250 travel scholarships to attendees for whom the cost to attend would otherwise be prohibitive. Please [contact us] if you need a scholarship to attend.
