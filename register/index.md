<p class="bodybig">Registration opens May 30 and tickets will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. SRCCON is a small event, and we anticipate releasing no more than 125 tickets, so if you&rsquo;re planning to attend, you may want to <a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/subscribe/">join our notifications list</a> or follow <a href="http://www.twitter.com/srccon">@SRCCON</a> on Twitter.</p>

Tickets will cost $150, and all attendees will need to purchase a ticket, including session leaders. Registration will cover your entry to the two-day conference and a couple of meals per day, plus snacks and coffee. By registering, you agree to support and abide by our [code of conduct](/conduct/).

We offer a small number of $500 travel scholarships to attendees for whom the cost to attend would otherwise be prohibitive. Travel scholarship applications will open when registration launches on May 30.

###We can use your help
We&rsquo;re going to need a small number of volunteers to make sure SRCCON runs smoothly and there&rsquo;s someone in the room to grab that extra pile of sticky notes or markers. If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about volunteering, please [email us](mailto:source@mozillafoundation.org).

We also have a community-wide request: if you know someone who loves to code and is interested in journalism and related work and you think they might enjoy SRCCON, please take a moment to send them to our site or [make an introduction](mailto:source@mozillafoundation.org), especially if you think they might not hear about it otherwise.
