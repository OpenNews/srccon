<p class="bodybig">SRCCON is a small event and we're tuning the program to the exact attendee list we have, so please let us know as soon as you can if you're not coming, because it may mean we'll need to tweak our program a little. If you find that you'll be unable to attend after all, you have two options: transfer your ticket to someone else (which is the quickest option), or get a refund (also fine but may take a little longer).</p>

###Transfer Your Ticket
You can transfer your SRCCON registration to someone else right up until July 22 with no charges or penalties. To switch the name on your ticket, just go back into your registration and change the registration information to the new person. Or you can email the person's name and contact information to [source@opennews.org](mailto:source@opennews.org), and we'll do the rest.

Don't know anyone you want to transfer your ticket to? We can help you find someone who needs a ticketâ€”email us at [source@opennews.org](mailto:source@opennews.org) and we'll get you fixed up.

###Cancel Your Ticket
If you need to cancel, please contact us at [source@opennews.org](mailto:source@opennews.org) and let us know. You can cancel with no penalty up until two weeks before the conference begins (July 15). After July 15, we can't refund your ticket, but you can still transfer it to someone else up until July 22.
