# Thank You for Answering the SRCCON 2019 Call for Participation!

We're excited to hear you'd like to be at SRCCON, and we’ll follow up with you soon!

Do you have a colleague who would be interested in or benefit from joining us in Minneapolis on July 11 & 12? Please ask them to apply! We hugely appreciate help reaching beyond our own networks, and personal recommendations are one of the best ways to help new folks find out about our events and bring more people into the community.

Between now and then, here are a couple of key dates in the SRCCON process:

* If you apply before May 8, you will hear back from us by May 10. 
* If you apply after May 8, you will hear from us within a few business days of submitting your form.
