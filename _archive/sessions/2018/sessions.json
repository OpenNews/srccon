We know the value that collaboration can add to projects by sharing the effort or including diverse perspectives. Yet it is challenging to build shared values of privacy and collaboration into a model that serves each individual organization and their needs. The Chicago Data Collaborative was a test to see if, together, news organizations, researchers, advocacy groups and civic technologists were greater than the sum of their parts. Today, the Chicago Data Collaborative is working to access data from public agencies, and then organize, document, and link that data together to help understand Chicago’s criminal justice system.\n\nIn this session, we will share some of the lessons we learned— from assessing the expertise and needs in our ecosystem to creating a data-sharing and governance agreement and a pilot database of criminal justice data. More importantly, as a group, we will discuss and navigate the steps to convene organizations and to create a sustainable model that reflects the goals of all parties involved.",

As more teams are given the freedom to experiment, the need for a practical model to do it with empathy, intention and a willingness to learn is ever greater. \n\nOver two years in the Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab we developed a sustainable process for running experiments by trying methods out until they (mostly) worked for us. In this session,  we’ll talk about the essential building blocks of our process, take it for a test run, and invite others to share methods they’ve used in their newsrooms. \n\nThe Mobile Lab’s methodology on its surface is pretty simple: \n* draw a line between an idea and an actual hypothesis\n* define success metrics based on all aspects of a user’s experience\n* implement precise analytics\n* survey your audience about how things went\n* have a “burndown” meeting with the entire team to discuss results and insights\n\nThe hard part, we admit, is putting this all together and not losing steam. \n\nFeel free to bring a news experiment idea you want to put through the paces, or we’ll have a few on file to suggest (Obituaries newsletter, anyone?!)",

Datasette also provides a JSON+SQL API that allows developers to quickly build apps and visualizations on top of that data.\n\nThis will be a hands-on tutorial.

We parachute into a community for a short time because something \"newsworthy\" happens rather than coming in to stay and maintain a steady relationship. Think Sutherland Springs and other locales of mass shootings. Think rural America and the 2016 presidential election. Think of the minority areas of our communities that remain underserved, underrepresented and without coverage aside from tragedies. \n\nHow do we put down the ripcord and instead pull up a chair in these communities? \n\nLet's spend some time learning how to do a baseline assessment of our news organization's coverage of diverse communities using analytics tools we already use everyday to identify blind spots. Let's arm ourselves with actionable strategies we can use when we return to our newsrooms and can use to have these difficult conversations about our coverage's shortcomings with top decision-makers. And finally, let's devise a set of best practices to engage diverse communities in the interim between news events and build lasting future relationships.",

I (and others) ended up helping them walk through the security disclosure process, helped draft messages intended to encourage users to upgrade, and poked people in the community.  There are individual things that folks who produce software for others can do to make this process easier for themselves & users, but also there are things that we should be doing as users to make sure we're prepared to upgrade when flaws are announced, and also, how to lend a hand when things are going wrong.

We'll practice iterating on ideas, freed from the computer. Inspired by the work of Mona Chalabi (who uses hand-drawn visualizations to make her work more accessible), Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi (who embarked on a year-long personal data collection postcard project which became the book Dear Data), and Jose Duarte (of Handmade Visuals), we will play with color, shape, size, and texture. \n\nI'll provide some supplies, but you're welcome to bring your own!

There are data journalists, developers, traditional beat reporters…and what does a producer do, anyway? This session is for all of you. Everyone will leave with their own personal roadmap, a one-sheet list that will come out of collaborative brainstorming. The point is to better understand ourselves, where we are situated and how to communicate in order to collaborate once we are back in our own newsrooms. Come and build your own map by joining us.\n\nAs we are all experiencing with the intersection of tech and journalism, journalists have to work with developers, data journalists have to work with designers; while product managers, producers and editors try to translate between them all. It can be frustrating to figure out how to do this well and not silently stew. We’ll work through the struggles with understanding and identify how to foster better collaboration and bridge communication gaps.\n\nThough newsrooms are working on innovative new projects with these teams more than ever, it can be difficult to know how to work with people whose skills you might not understand; and even more tricky to lead those teams.\n\nThe aim is to leave this workshop with a better handle on how you can work better and more collaboratively upon your return to work.",

Well, your days of worrying about front-end design could soon be over. Slack's suite of API's are vast and the documentation is one of the best of any API out there. In this session, I'll quickly demo most of the different methods of interaction available with Slack's APIs. We'll build a simple graphics request form together as a group. When that's finished, we'll brainstorm ideas for other newsroom tools and discuss how our front-end needs could be met by one or more of the methods we've seen so far. We'll be using Flask to do it, so basic Flask and Python knowledge will be required.\n\nSlack has a number of features you might need from a front-end design already included. Unprompted function calls? Slack has slash commands. Do they support arguments? You bet they do. Filling out forms? Slack's got that too. Giving personal user feedback when a script runs? Ephemeral messages make sure that only a single user can see the notification without ever having to leave the channel. Learn about all these and more in the session.",
