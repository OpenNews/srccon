Room: Ullyot

>> Hi.  Hello.  Am I on?  All right.  Hi, everyone.  I'm Dan Sinker, if you don't know me I'm the Director of the Knight-Mozilla Open News Project.  And I'm apparently hitting "settings" on my phone.  I'm really thrilled to be kicking SRCCON off today and I'm incredibly amazed that everybody is here on time especially because a lot of you got delayed due to the monsoon that blew through last night.  So thanks for getting here, and dealing with some travel hiccups.  About a year and a half ago I was sitting next to Erin Kissane in the Knight CAR Conference in Louisville and it was during the lightning talks which are amazing if you've been to Knight CAR and I'm going to guess the Venn diagram of people that have been to Knight CAR, and the people that are here almost looks like a circle.  And I lean over to person and I said, "You know what, I want a conference that's all this.  I want a conference that's all of this but not in five minute shots, okay?"  I want this level of passion and this level of fun, and this level of commitment for the whole time, right?  I want people to be able to talk and to learn about teach in equal amounts.  And I want people to be able to build new things together and that was about a year and a half and about six months ago.  We were like, okay, maybe we should do a conference.  And about three months ago, we sat in a conference room in Portland, Oregon and we spent literally, the first, what, three hours discussing the emotional arc of the conference, and we divided that that's the team that should be putting together a conference.  Anyway, we're here.  This is a conference filled with your passions with your ideas, and it's an event that's about sharing as much as it is about learning:  Whether it's sharing things that you're doing.  Whether it's sharing coffee.  All sorts of different things will get shared this weekend -- or two days.  We're so excited about doing this with you.  But first we want to get a couple of things out of the way.  We're going to talk a little bit about the schedule and the arc of the next couple of days.  Probably not touch on the emotional arc as much as the actual, physical teaser of the things you do.  We're going to talk about some of the expectations that we have of you.  Some of our ground rules, and some additional information you need to know.  And finally, this is going to be a bit of a cluster but we're actually going to get to know all of you in this session.  But before we do any of that, this is a conference literally couldn't have happened without a lot of people doing a lot of things and I want to introduce three of the folks who are responsible for SRCCON as much as anyone.  So Ryan Pitts, Erika Owens, and Erin Kissane.
>> Hello, I'm Ryan.  And first of all, I have to say, it is so awesome to look out and see all of you here.  So, I just want go over real quick kind of what we'll spend the next two days doing together.  Some of you may have seen it already.  We have a schedule app available for you, it's at schedule.srccon.org.  Even if the conference Wi-Fi goes down, you will still have that schedule app available to you.  If you take a look through it we have the next two days divided into morning blocks and afternoon blocks.  We'll have sessions filling I up both of those.  And if you look at those blocks you'll see that there's a couple of codes for the section sessions, the lighter of which, the CSS pioneers will identify as "papaya whip" that designates one-hour sessions, and the blue those designate two and a half hour sessions.  So each session block has two, one and a half hour sessions with a two and a half block hour in between so if you go to a long session say at 11:00 today, that will run through until lunch.  What we'll do is finish up our time here together.  We'll get you out of here so you can greet, coffee, grab some snacks and the first block goes until we break for lunch at 1:30 and then we're going to turn you loose, set you free, stretch out your legs, go about on your own and then we come back here for our afternoon blocks which starts at 3:00 we'll take our afternoon section sessions at 5:30 which, taco bar.  And we also have an bunch of local beers for you guys to drink.  We'll drink in here for a while, and then at 7:00 we'll kind of redistribute to different rooms for what we've been starting to call the "house party."  So I want to take a second and introduce you to a few people who will be leading you through different rooms.  We have different activities set up in different rooms tonight.  Starting at 7:00, the Foodie Room, Jeremy Bowers, are you here?  This is Jeremy Bowers, he is our Hufflepuff Prefects.  If you're interested in food and things like that.  Talk to Jeremy, he is running that session.  We have a game room, Jeff Phonako, are you here?  And and Jeff -- he is a board game master.  He has a lot of things planned, and Eric will be running a Magic: The Gathering tournament.  And we have cards, and we have plans, Eric knows how to run a draft.  Come and play a few games.  Those are our Gryffindors.  Where are our Ravenclaws?  Those are our lighting talk coordinators.  If you have a passion that you can talk in about five minutes and come get people excited about, come do a lighting talk.  Our Hacking Room, the Slytherins.  And the NYT Labs Crew will be talking about hacking, hobbies, science fair-type displays that people are interested in.  So our house party will need to wrap up around 9:00.  There are literal alarms that turn on in this building at around 10:00, so we do need a hard stop there.  Of course, you guys are all welcome to go out, find refreshing beverages, keep talking to people.  We won't get back together until tomorrow morning, though.  We'll have breakfast here.  And then with a morning session at 11:00 that runs through, and we'll have lunch together in this room tomorrow.  And then our afternoon sessions start at 3:00 and then we'll get back together for a short closing wrap-up at 5:30 tomorrow afternoon where we'll talk about kind of what we've experienced and hopefully what we'll see everybody doing together going forward.  So that's the next couple of days.  Eric and Erika are going to talk about some logistics now.
>> Thanks.  So I am excited that everyone is here in Philly.  So I live in Philly, so welcome.  We hope you enjoy your time here and it's also really exciting to be in this space.  You're going to get to see there's actually natural light, there's greenery outside.  It's not your typical conference space.  There's also a museum that you can go to at any point when the museum is open throughout the conference time.  So it's a really great space.  We hope you enjoy it, and I just wanted to tell you about a few logistics items.  So one logistics item that is probably at the top of your mind is the Internet access and so there are signs around this room.  And throughout upstairs about Internet access.  So, the Wi-Fi password, it's 0102030405.  It's easy to remember-ish.  And we request that you turn things off like Dropbox and syncing apps just to conserve the bandwidth to make sure that we can access it during the event.  And also another thing with the events there are people in coordinated shirts.  So the volunteers are in the snazzy orange shirts and the staff are in the snazzy blue shirts.  So these are people to contact if you have any questions, or if anything comes up.  And we have different volunteers in different roles to support session leaders.  So help prep the space.  So there'll be people on hand to help us in different ways.  But you can always tap us on the shoulders to discuss anything else that you need to know about.  So just to tell you a little bit about the session rooms.  We're going to be here for these big group events but we're going to be going upstairs to where all the session rooms are.  You can see the map on the back of your lanyard in a handy way that's easy to look at.
>> Just twist!  Just twist, and it faces you!
>> I'm sorry, I'm not a very good demonstrator.  But you can experiment yourself.
[ Laughter ]
So in each of the session rooms, there is a packet of Post-Its and Sharpies, and foot boards, and whiteboards, and projectors, and all the fun things that you'll need for your session and there'll be particular volunteers supporting the sessions, as well.  So that should be -- it should be great.  And in front of every room is the name of the room and the sessions that are coming up this morning so you can more easily find where you're heading.  And we also wanted to let you know about some other folks in the room are transcribers.  We're doing live transcription for about half of the sessions at SRCCON which we're really, really excited about.  So just wanted to introduce those folks to you.  So Stan is actually transcribing this session right now.  He's that table over there, typing up here.  Allison, do you want to raise your hand to indicate Stan?
           Awesome.  And Norma and Lora are over by the door.  You'll see these folks in your room and they'll be taking down what people are saying so that we have a record of it and also for accessibility for people outside of the session who weren't able to make it as well.  So that's linked up on the site and I think that's about it and I'll turn it over to Erin for a few more details.
           
           
So just an extension on the transcription piece -- we're so psyched to have transcribers here, by the way.  They are awesome people.

[ Applause ]
Just because there are, you know, various kinds of situations where in a session you may want to tell a personal story, you may want to talk about something that's kind of under friend DA, that you don't want necessarily going out, necessarily, in a live transcription over the Internet.  That's fine.  What we're asking is that you say, "I'm going to take this off the record" which, is the term that we figure y'all already know.  Make sure you tell them when to go back on the record.  It'll be like the VCR -- I'm old -- and you go off for the commercials.  And don't joke around and say, "Don't put this down."  Like, the magic words are, "I'm going off the record" and then they'll take it off and then say, "We're back on."  So that's happening.  And all those transcripts are going to be archived on the sites afterwards.  So you'll access to those.  I also want to talk a little bit about just some policy stuff.  We have a code of conduct.  Lots of people have an code of conduct and it's a good thing to have but we wanted to call it out specifically because it's sort of more than fine print for us.  We think of it as an expression for a lot of the complex ethics of this community.  So it's not just that we don't post outside.  You can see it online at srccon.org/conduct.  The spirit is, be considerate in your speech and actions to your fellow attendees and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of the people that you're hanging out with.  Anything else is really midrash.  Those are the core things.  If you have a problem, if you have a health or safety issue, if you see something that makes you uncomfortable, if you see something that seems to be not in that spirit, there is a number to call that will reach the staff and that is SRCCON-2909.  You can also find me, but if you see my arm, you don't need to call the number.  You know, if you don't have access to your phone or whatever, grab a volunteer and they'll get one of us.  But the thing is we're here to help you.  If you have an emergency and someone is bleeding, call 911 first and then call us.  But if it's not an actual, like, "emergency services" emergency, let one of us know and we will come help you.  For that matter if you're stranded in a room, and you need Post-Its, feel free to call us also, which'll be fun for us, because we'll think someone is bleeding from the head.  Another policy think is, just a quick photo policy if you're going to take a group photo -- actually if you're going to take a photo of an identifiable human being, just give a warning to anyone who doesn't want to be photographed.  And if someone says, don't post that picture, just honor that request.  This is all sort of basic stuff, but sort of pay attention to that.  And food, I like to talk about that.  A lot of people folks have allergic dietary restrictions.  If you know you have something like that, and you haven't told us -- shellfish will kill you or something like that -- let one of us in the blue shirts know.  Everything should be labeled so that everyone is safe from food.  And sort of related to that if you see something that looks delicious but it's the gluten-free, soy-free, vegan.  Don't eat that unless you need to eat it because other people will be hungry instead.  If you are observing a fast for Ramadan or anything else just grab one of us, and if there's anything that we can do to accommodate we'll be happy to hold the food for later or whatever for you.  And just a note about the building, the stairs just between the two floors we're on go through the museum and you can't have food in the museum so that means, food stays where you get it.  If you eat food down here, it stays down here.  If you eat food upstairs, coffee, or whatever, it gets eaten upstairs.  It can't travel between floors.  It's a little weird.  But you can't have cupcakes next to the original container that they used to invent Bakelite in, which is kind of tragic.  Anything else on the logistics?  All right I'm going to turn it back over to you.

>> One other room logistics or building logistics thing.  If you are a mom who needs room to pump, there is one.  Let one of us know and we can direct you to how to get into that, because it's actually not in a direct space but it is a designated space for that.  So if you need that, we've got that.  At Open News we've done a lot of events for a while, and every time we open them, we borrow some rules from our friend and colleague Gunnar.  Anyone who knows Gunnar, doesn't know his last name.  But he lays out awesome ways of conducting yourself especially in a room like this where every single one of you is so damn brilliant.  One is focusing on listening you know we all have things that we want to impart on with each other but don't be the person who hogs up everyone else's opportunity to share their brilliance, as well.  Honor the schedule.  We are trying our best to honor the schedule, to lead by example.  Things happen on time.  As Ryan said, they do set alarms in this building.  I'm convinced they also flood it with Halon gas.  So be sure to honor the schedule so that we can continue on time.  Resist the desire to debate, right?  It is okay to disagree.  It's not okay to take over a session trying to force your opinion down everyone else's throats.  And these two, I think, are the most important for an event like this.  One is be willing to ask questions and when you're asking those questions, a big one is, all of us come here with an incredible amount of jargon, right?  And, it's okay if somebody starts jargoning to say, "I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean when you're talking about how Heartbleed was compromised by Open SSL," or whatever it was that was supposed to come out of my mouth.  It's okay to ask questions when you don't understand something.  In fact, it's the only thing that you can learn.  And finally, talk to people you don't know.  We are a community that one of the things that's been interesting to me, leading into this, is how many people said, "Man, I looked at the etherpad that people created of people attending and there's so many people that I think I know but then I realize that I don't actually know."  All right, so get to know people, whether you think you know them or you totally don't know them, get to know them this weekend.  So looping quickly back to SRCCON.  We anticipated a lot of SRCCON.  We anticipated that you love coffee and so we have two coffee hacking stations with grinders and scales and seven different ways to brew your coffee and beans beyond belief.  We anticipated that you wanted to learn things.  We created sessions and times for that.  We anticipated that you wanted to have fun, so we created the evening.  We did not anticipate that this session -- that this conference was going to sell out in three minutes.  And ever since that day, we've worked super hard to live up to that expectation, right, because it's definitely something that all of us were like, "Oh, shit.  Now we've really got to have a conference."  And we know that the topics that are being discussed over the next two days, whether they're things like CMSs, or security, or the incredible lead for more diversity in this field, that these are topics that are important to journalism.  That they're important to the web, and most importantly, they're important to you, right?  And we know that because we asked you.  Every session at SRCCON was proposed, is being run, and of course is being attended by you, right?  But "attend" really isn't the right word.  SRCCON is is highly participatory.  One of the things that kept coming up when we asked people what this conference should be like was, "I want to just compare notes with people," right?  I want to figure out the way that I'm doing things and the way this person's doing things.  I want to figure out how we can do those things together, right?  These sessions are where your voice is as valuable as the voices of the people that are leading them.  So really by signing on here, you've signed on to play the part of sharing your experiences, sharing your knowledge, and really being active in this.  And that's really what this conference is about, I think.  It's about sharing notes and experiences, and helping each other chart uncharted waters, right?  The work that we do in newsrooms is not tested by doing hundreds of years of doing news.  It's tested by months, sometimes hours.  So whether you've been doing journalism work that's been around for decades or centuries, or one that's been around for a matter of months.  We're all kind of feeling our way through this together.  And the best way to do that is to work together to find your way, right?  Probably also drink a lot of coffee.  But working together also to make coffee is a good thing.  And so I think it's only appropriate that we actually take a second here -- it's going to take more than a second, spiritual alert -- to get to know each other.  So if anyone's been to a food conference we're going to steal their move.  Each of you is going to say three things, your name, where you're from, and brief keywords about yourself.  And by three, I don't mean paragraphs, I mean words.  The way that we're going to do this, we're going to hand two mics.  This is one and this is the other one.  I'm going to hand it to my colleagues who are going to demonstrate best practices, first.  One person will say this, the next person, the next two people at the table will be standing with a mic ready to go.  When person one finishes, they will hand their mic to person three, and person two will then, introduce, and person three will be standing and we're going to blow this shit up!  So we'll start.  I'm person one.  I'm Dan Sinker, I'm from Chicago, I'm not moving from Chicago, at least for now.  And, goats, tacos, building stuff.

I think we can do better, so let's do it again.  
[ Laughter ]
Note, you've got 12 minutes until our 11:00 sessions start.  That took a while but I think it's super important that everyone gets names attached to their faces.  Their names attached to your neck, as well.  Again, user guide:  Just twist it, and there's the map facing you.  But yeah, there's about 12 minutes or so to your session.  If you're a session leader, you I want to head up sooner than that and just get your session going.  There are waters clearly labeled, session leader waters in the rooms.  Those are for you.  And yeah they're up on the second floor -- the coffee hacking stations exist.  And they are there for you and there's a wonderful coffee guy by the name of Cory who's not making you coffee but he will help you make coffee.  And you can help each other as well and have an wonderful, wonderful morning.  And Eric has a shout-out.
>> Also one quick thing.  There's elevators that go up, as well as the stairwell that's in the museum.  So there's a lot of us going up there right now, so use both of those opportunities.
>> Have an wonderful time?  There are two, one-hour sessions.  Lunch is out in this wonderful historic place.  We will see you soon.  Have an wonderful time.
