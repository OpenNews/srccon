Making things happen with small teams
Session facilitator(s): Kaeti Hinck
Day & Time: Friday, 3-4pm
Room: Franklin 1

>>  All right, guys, let's get started.
>> Hi, everyone ... ... OK, thanks for coming.  I'm Kaeti Hinck, if you don't know me, I work at MinnPost, and we are a small team, and one of the reasons I wanted to have this conversation with you, is just the collective wisdom of other people who are working on small teams and smaller organizations can really be of benefit to each other, so to start, I just want to quickly go around, just say your name, where you're working, where you're from, and just one sentence about something that you're hoping to get out of this session.  And if that makes you really nervous, you don't have to do that, you can just say your name, where you're from.
>> Dan Herman, The Daily Record, just hoping to find tips on prioritizing things.
>> Emmy Crowell, I ... trying to figure out how to build small teams.
>> Jessica, I'm at Mashable, and I'm a team of two trying to build out a whole section, so I'm trying to figure out how I can best do that.
>> Emma.  I work at foreign policy and I'm a small team in a small newsroom.
>> David Yanofsky, I'm a reporter at Quartz, and I'm on a team of two:
>> I'm Ryan Murphy, I'm at the Texas Tribune, and right now we're -- counting a couple fellows and an intern, we're a team of 6.
>> Tom S...., I work at Harvard Business Review, and I'm a team of one.
>> Caitlin I'm at Chicago Tribune news apps team, just again, another small team, in this case, working with a big newsroom and sometimes other newsrooms within a larger organization, so ...
>> Alan P.  I work at MinnPost, as well, just want to hear what other people have to say.
>> There is no I in team, but there is a me, but so actually I've recently joined up with an intern.  So I'm interested in figuring out how to go with somebody who manages his own work to work alongside someone else and have them have a beneficial experience.
>> I'm Evie from Internet KPCC, so I hope to find out how an entry level data journalist can find his or her position in the newsroom, like how to follow the leaders and do my job as well as I can.
>> Adam?
>> Oh, hi, I'm Adam.  I work at INN, which is it's like 100 small teams, and I have a small team that supports all of these small teams.  It's a lot of small teams.  I'm actually very interested in especially like process, and sort of structure of small teams and how to kind of manage all of that.  And the right amount of, I guess, like rigor around process management and structure.
>>
>> My name is Leon, I'm from Toronto, I just recently got into data journalism, sort of from a software development background, and the way I'm kind of doing it is by doing a lot of freelance work, I'm doing it all on my own, sort of depending on NICAR, listserv and other places for information, just trying to get a picture of where I might be able to fit in, what I'd be good at and how I could serve.
>> I'm Nelly with American Presence, too, and we do a lot of training with other newsrooms that are sometimes quite small, so looking to learn about processes on workload, but more importantly transferable processes on workloads.
>> Alexis, Center for Public Integrity on a team of like 6 people, but I'm the only news app guy on the team.  So yeah, I'm interested in like how not to get swallowed by news organization, and ...  Also we're hiring, so we're going to be working with new people.
>> I'm Sarah, I work for MarketWatch in New York.  Team of one, wondering about working with an editor, not a developer, not a designer, is just kind of the head of a larger section and possibly growing into a team of two and how that division happens.  Division of labor.
>> I'm Mike, Boston Globe, also interested in process and project management and how teams go about their work.
>>
>> I'm John, New York Times legal design, so nine of us in a newsroom, I think now that I'm living in sort of and trying to figure out what the right combinations of folks are and how to put them together and be successful in such a large place.
>> Sarah, Washington Post, I used to run a team of designers, and then I ran a larger team of the digital folks, and then I moved to New York and I'm starting a new team, and there's only one other person so far, so working on different-sized teams and figuring out how that works.
>> I'm Jacob Sanderson at Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.  I am often a team of one but often a member of another team or a series of teams that are not only across newsroom departments, but across business units in IT and things like that, sort of just across the entire company.  So I go figuring out how to better work with them, how to prioritize my time, so that those teams are more successful.
>> We provide support for high traffic so our team is often:  [inaudible] so I run a pretty small team and [inaudible]
>> Noah, WNIC data news team, with a team of five, I'm interested in how to avoid bottlenecks within our team.
>> I'm Ryan Mark, I'm from Vox Media, and we've just recently kind of changed the way our teams work so that we have a new team of about four or five, four and a half.  That does stuff for a whole bunch of people onsite.
>> Brian, ProPublica, applications team of 8.  Interested in how we could do things.
>> [inaudible]
>> I'm a freelancer:
>> I'm -- I work for -- David works with us, too, but he doesn't do anything, alas.  I'm interested in seeing how small teams manage the tension between doing like long-term stuff and more time sensitive stuff, so yeah, ...  

>>Cool.  So how we're going to structure this is first talking about obstacles and we're going to have you guys all write down individually one obstacle that you feel prevents you from doing the work you want to do or doing it as well as you wish you could.  Because --
>> I'm sorry, could you speak up a little?  The cooling is really loud.
>> Yes, and I speak at the same frequency as it, so so I will try to project.  After we write down obstacles, we can talk in our groups about those obstacles and write down very specific tactics or solutions, things that have worked for us or made that problem easier and then come back together at the end and do a group share around what works for us and what doesn't and ways we can work together as small teams.  There are post-it notes on every table, grab one, and just take a minute to write down one obstacle that you've encountered in your work.
[group activity]
All right, if you haven't started already, feel free to share what you've written with your group at the table and then from there, pick one of the obstacles you might found overlap in what you've written, but start with one and just talk through a couple of questions like you know, what's made this easier for us in the past, what didn't work when we tried it and if somebody could be a note-taker for each group and just quickly a list of solutions and tactics that you come up with as you talk about specific obstacles.
[group activity]
  ... ... ... ... ...  ... ...
>> Let's take a couple more minutes and then wrap up and talk as a whole group.
>>
OK, let's circle back up, everyone, wrap things up:  All right, so now I want to talk as a whole group, and kind of walk through some of the things that the smaller groups talked about, and write down some of those obstacles and solutions, and then hopefully we have a lot of things to take away with us, including being connected with this whole community of people.  So if you guys want to start, what was one of the obstacles, you talked about?
>>
>> Time.
>> Time.
>> Mortality.
[laughter]
>> That limited resource, mortality.
>> So what are some of the solutions you talked about?  The tactics?
>> So there was part of, like a lot of the time issues is not just us wanting to do our own work for our own teams, but also the work that we do to help other people in our organization, so identifying the things that could benefit from training other people in your organization, could benefit from finding some sort of power user or, you know, subject matter expert that you can deflect people to, or if it's a task that you're often doing, find a way to either automate it for yourself, or create a tool for those other people to use.
>> And like Chartbuilder.
>> Heard of that.
>> You have, really?
[laughter]
>> Did you talk about any others?
>> We talked about like just kind of interacting with people and when you feel like they're wasting your time or you're wasting their time, just having things like manners and using bribes or customer service language to kind of just like make that something that you know is like a bad interaction to overall just feel better about that, because if you are in a small newsroom and like, you know, people can see you.
>> Mm-hm.
>>
>> How about table in the back?
>> I think a big thing, oh, sorry, us?
>> Sure.
>> I think a couple a couple of us had talked about was not having other programmers with the same skills on your team, like just no one to go to with questions or just even just to talk shop with.
>> What were some of the ideas you talked about for that.
>> The internet.
>> Well, there was a suggestion of having a more robust like news nerd-specific IRC help situation.
>> What !?
>> We had the same conversation.
>> Yeah, we were talking about that, too.
>> There's an empty IRC room that nobody talks in.  It's out there now.
>>
>> Any other tactics on that one?
>> Another one was that sometimes editorial isn't really aware of the possibilities, like the digital possibilities that you can provide, so the solutions.
>> Or, yeah, they're overly aware, but.
>> Yeah, they haven't found the sweet spot.
>> Exactly.  And some of the solutions for that were including creating another exposure, making sure that you emphasize they should just send you if the problem is not enough exposure, they should loop you into pretty much everything and you can sort of winnow it down and let them know why you are and aren't taking on projects.
>> I think a lot of people in this room are inhabiting roles that are pretty new and everyone is still kind of figuring out like what works and what doesn't and how to fit in as part of a newsroom that might have, you know, decades of history of it its own behind it, and so just figuring out how do you integrate all this new stuff and the new processes that that entails with existing place.
>> Yeah, I definitely think the more we talk about it and don't just disappear into our corners and assume that editorial will come to us and the more integrated we can be, the better off we'll all be eventually.
>> I think we were also talking about have a checklist for reporters and editors before they pitch the ideas to us, so they don't present us immature or just impossible stuff and we have to say no.
>>
>> Yeah, I think that's great, the more we can kind of codify the process so they know what we need and we know what they need and enough time to actually get things done.
>> Kind of along that line and this goes back to the customer servicing we were talking about, maybe it should almost never be a definite no, but a that's a great idea I'm glad to see you're thinking about data, here's why that might not work because we don't have time to create a map for the entire United States.  Have you thought about putting it into something that's more manageable and that way you put it back on them to think about data in general.
>> Yeah, we explain the whys behind the nos that we have to give, I think everybody is much happier and then understands how to come back and rethink the project.
>> It can still be an excited no.  Not, "No, screw off," but just no, but ...
[laughter]
>> How about you guys?
>>
>> Talked about sort of a little bit related to the not having someone else with the same expertise, but having single points of failure and having knowledge that's just in one person's brain so when that person is not there, suddenly there's a big problem.  And we talked about solutions sort of buddy system training with documentation as a required output of that training process:
>> Also, work flows that prevents the point of failure, so that one thing Ryan's team did was every week they had someone responsible for emergencies, so that the other -- like the team would stay focused and if there was like a fire or a breaking news situation or whatever, there was one person who was responsible for handling that and the rest of the team could stay working until they were pulled in for a certain reason.
>> Mm-hm.
>> Yeah, one thing that we've done with that redundancy problem is we've done a couple of small trainings where like, you know, Alan will have built a process and we'll sit with Tom and I who are the other members of the team and walk us through how he does it.  We might never actually have to do that, but we know how, and we can access that if we need to, so we each are taking turns doing the skill-sharing thing so we always understand what the other team members are doing.
>> So, any other obstacles to talk about?
>> Getting requests and sort of like can't you do X questions.  One thing that my team does is we try to funnel all of those requests through our morning standup, so we try to get people as much as possible to come when we're all there at the same time every morning at 10:30, talking through this, which helps to clarify what the request actually is, and helps us talk about different tradeoffs involved, and concerns.
>>
>> We also talked about having like a worksheet or a basic document that you know, outlines what a project should be, and what should be done and why, to kind of have a --
>>
>> Have a maybe a document or something that explains what it is, and kind of is something that everybody can agree to.
>> And the scope of things, as well.
>> And then requiring something like that so people don't just kind of hop on a project and start making something about ... [inaudible]
>> We also talked about better processes at the very beginning for making sure that roles are clearly defined, and even allowing for some necessary overlaps, as you don't always want just one idea from one place, but also as much as possible narrowly defining who the stakeholders are, so it doesn't become this unwieldy, giant, out-of-control conversation.
>> So what do people do with the folks who jump in at the end of the conversation who, say, weren't part of the stakeholder group?
>> Give them lots of middle finger.
[laughter]
>> Maybe doesn't fit the manners one, but --
>> I am ill-mannered ...  How about you guys?  On the view.
>> On the topic of the IRC, we were discussing maybe HipChat.
>> How many people in this room use Slack or HipChat?
>>
>> How many used IRC in the past week?
>> Fewer:
>> I wonder if it's something that maybe even Mozilla OpenNews couldn't run, it seemed like there was a lot of interest of having a channel for that for people to learn.
>> Yeah, it's important that we support each other and our peers at small organization, because as we figure things out, we can share ideas and failures, too, like hey, this did not work at all, but what have other people done and maybe it's even like a listserv or something, but yeah.
>> Mozilla OpenNews has an IRC channel.
>> I say large and small, like the people that are at this conference, the people that are in this community, are very open to helping the other people you meet, like you have met people here, you get them on Twitter, get their email addresses.  I know of situations where people at very large publications have like woken up early every Thursday morning to teach people at other organizations to code Javascript, just because they, you know, want more people to be doing this, and I know I've had phone calls with, and sent emails to lots of people when I was having code problems or other issues and people are more than typically to help.  Ooh.
>> Just a standard one place for people to go to.
>> I mean NICAR-L is an excellent place.
>> I've had hit or miss.  It seems like it's either overtechnical or undertechnical or the listserv gets bombed.  I feel everyone here is at least at the same level when it comes to code and what we're focused on.  That's the community I'd rather reach out to other than people who either don't know how to do it or they can only tell you their one specific thing because they're very specific and very specialized.
>> It's a narrow universe but within that it's a lot of different type of folks which makes it interesting, but also people that have specific problems.  I feel like what we really need is some sort of directory for each person who wants to offer help, like ask me about these things and I have a problem with X, who are the best people to go to about that and I think a lot of us anecdotally have that in our heads, who are the people we've crossed paths with that we can talk about these things.
>> And I also think, we've got a pay-it-forward thing, like we've all been helped by other organizations and other people as we've learned these skills and built out our team in an organization, and so do the time, don't wait for somebody to come to you necessarily but reach out to the people who are just getting started and facing the organization challenges that we've gone through:
>> Did you talk about any other obstacles?
>> We talked some of this burden of like project management versus getting actual work done and how much rigor and all that kind of stuff, and I think on the --
>> We weren't very helpful.
>> I don't think we solved, I think that one.  You know, because it varies, like, depending on the team, and in some cases, the answer hire a project manager, but it's always hard, I think, to sort of balance the like right amount of rigor, or the -- sort of correct way of doing the estimation for your like team and there's a lot -- I think, that we actually like can do around shared, common like language and how we just about talk about this and defining a process, and making sure everyone like buys into it and have that kind of defined and codified, that at least helps, you know, but doesn't solve the sort of like problem necessarily just depending on the team and like diversity of projects and everything else, right, in some cases the answer is like still probably that you actually like need a project manager.
>> Just out of curiosity, how many of you in the room have some sort of defined work flow or process for doing projects in your organization? how many of you wish you had that?  So that's one thing where we can be a help to each other, too, like different processes work for different size organizations in different ways, like you know for a team of two or one, going through like a very rigorous software development process might not work for you, it might create more work instead of facilitating the ability to work more effectively.
>> But I do think it's helpful to be able to talk --
>> I mean I'd say that you know it's even if you're a person -- if you're a single developer working, having a way to keep track of everything that's transparent to others is incredibly important.  Like even if it's something you've come up with yourself, it's always easier to pick up a book and/or go and take a class and learn you know, how project management is done and kind of follow in the foot steps of other people who've been doing it and using that as a basis for how you manage stuff, but it's always going to help and as a developer myself who never did any sort of project management or worked in an environment with project management for like the first half of my career, like I always thought would be a big pain in the ass, and it is not something I like really enjoy doing.  Like I don't like writing documents and I don't like entering tickets and keeping track of all that stuff, but it's just become an indispensable part of how I do my work.
>> The idea that you don't need something because you work on a small team is totally a red herring.  I worked on a dev team with just two of us and we had a very strict methodology.  I thought it was heavy handed but it was really useful.  We got a lot of stuff done and we were accountable for all the stuff we did.
>> I think the transparency piece is very important if you're trying to convince the broader organization your value as a team and helping them understand what it means to build out a news application or whatever sort of development project you're working on, they need to know how you work and having some sort of clear process helps people sort that out and then they know what to bring you and how long it's going to take and all of that.
>> And then they can't accuse you of not doing anything, because then you can go back and say, look at all the things we did.  I made a list of all the stuff that I did, and I checked it off as I did it and it can help prevent people from forcing a lot of work on you that you don't know how to do, you know, like, you can keep your workload under control.
>> When you're doing that, too, you're also documenting your problem solving, so it may be a pain in the ass in the moment to create those documents, but then you have a reference point, too, if you run into something similar again, you know, 18 months from now, three days from now, oh, crap, what do I do --
>> Yeah, don't test my memory, ever ever.
>> Oh, right, on this project and you go back through it and there's the process.
>> That's a hard thing about a small team, also a new team, there is no institutional.  Every time you try something, it's going to be the hard I am too, it's the first time and it's a little bit life-draining, and so balancing that out with like we want to do lots of things, lots of new things, but every time it's hard.  Every time it's new documentation like that.
>>
>> And one thing we try to do, just to keep people in the loop about what we're, working on at the moment is we have a big white board that has our current projects, and we don't keep that like religiously updated but it gives people enough info who are in the newsroom as they walk by, they're be like oh, yeah, Alan is looking into doing a request on this, and Katie is working on the design and they just see that we're working on that in the projects that we're working on in the newsroom.
>> Also, good documentation is a great way to undercut lots of meetings.
>> Yes, and the more we can undercut meetings the better, right?
>> So we're over time, but I want to encourage you all -- I created an etherpad for this group, because it's sort of self- selected community of people who want to work.  So add your info.  I also posted it on my Twitter account did you phone want to write it down from there.  I'll post all the notes and things that you talked about.  So the note takers if you could either send me the notes or just leave them here if you did them handwritten, that would be awesome.  And thank you so much for coming ... ...
