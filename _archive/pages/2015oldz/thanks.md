<h1>Thank you for submitting a proposal to SRCCON!</h1>

We'll notify all proposers about the status of their sessions by Friday, April 24, and we expect to publish our list of accepted sessions on Tuesday, April 28. If you like, you can [submit another proposal](/sessions/pitch). If you’re all set, please consider inviting friends and colleagues to submit a proposal and join us in Minneapolis July 25-26.

**Reminder:** Because SRCCON is a collaborative, peer-to-peer event, rather than a series of prepared conference talks, all participants must buy a ticket—this approach also helps us keep our ticket prices low and allows us to offer scholarships to those who need help with travel and lodging expenses. The facilitators of all accepted sessions will be given an opportunity to purchase a ticket before the public on-sale date. SRCCON tickets go on public sale April 29, and we expect them to sell out very quickly.
