**The SRCCON 2017 ticket lottery is now closed. Thanks to all who entered.** Our lottery system is designed to distribute tickets in a more equitable fashion than a first-come-first-served system that rewards the fastest internet connections or twitchiest mouse-fingers.

Here's what you need to know about getting a SRCCON ticket:

* The lottery is open **May 3 until 12 Eastern on May 10.**
* Tickets to SRCCON are $195. In addition to the purchase price, there is an $11.72 fee from our ticket service.
* Each person selected will be able to purchase a single ticket.
* **Tickets are non-transferrable and _may only_ be claimed by the individual selected in the lottery.**
* You will be notified of your status in the lottery (selected or not) by **5pm Eastern on May 11.** If selected, you will have until 5pm Eastern on Sunday, May 14, to buy your ticket.
* If you are not selected and if any unsold tickets remain after the purchase window closes, we will hold a second-chance lottery, drawn from unselected names from the lottery, on Monday, May 15, and will notify about status by the end of that same day.
* If you are selected for the second-chance lottery, you will have until 5pm Eastern on Thursday, May 18, to purchase a ticket.

## Financial & family assistance

We offered a limited number of [travel scholarships](/scholarships) to help people who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend. The scholarship is now closed and applicants will be notified alongside notifications for the ticket lottery.

In addition to financial assistance, we know that making sure you have coverage for your children is important, so we also offer attendees [free childcare](/childcare) run by providers we trust with our own kids.

## Sponsor tickets

If you're unable to get a ticket via the lottery and your organization is able to become a SRCCON sponsor, each level of sponsorship has tickets available, either as a part of the sponsorship package or held for reserved purchase. We offer a full rundown of available packages on [our sponsor page](/sponsors).
