## Thank you for submitting a proposal to SRCCON 2017!

We read through every session idea soon after it comes in, and we'll publish yours on the [SRCCON proposals page](/sessions/proposals) soon. If you like, you can [submit another session proposal](/sessions/proposals/pitch) right now. If you're all set, please consider inviting friends and colleagues to submit proposals and join us in Minneapolis on August 3 & 4. Between now and then, here are a couple of key dates in the SRCCON session review process:

* The call for proposals closes at 11:59pm ET, **Friday, April 7**.
* We'll notify all proposers about the status of their sessions by **Wednesday, April 26**.

**Reminder:** Because SRCCON is a collaborative, peer-to-peer event, rather than a series of prepared conference talks, we ask that all participants buy a ticket. We'll reserve a ticket for purchase by facilitators of accepted sessions, and they won't need to enter the public ticket lottery in May.
