<h1>Thank you for submitting a proposal to SRCCON 2016!</h1>

We'll notify all proposers about the status of their sessions by Wednesday, May 11. If you like, you can [submit another proposal](/sessions/pitch). If youâ€™re all set, please consider inviting friends and colleagues to submit a proposal and join us in Portland July 28 and 29.

**Reminder:** Because SRCCON is a collaborative, peer-to-peer event, rather than a series of prepared conference talks, all participants must buy a ticket. The facilitators of all accepted sessions will be given an opportunity to purchase a ticket before the public sale, which opens May 18.
