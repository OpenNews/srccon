Register now for our SRCCON ticket lottery! If we draw your name in the lottery, you'll be able to purchase a single, non-transferrable ticket for $195, plus $11.72 in ticket fees, and you'll be attending SRCCON August 3 & 4 in Minneapolis.

Alongside our ticket lottery registration, this same form is where you apply for a [travel scholarship](/scholarships) to SRCCON. Please check the corresponding box on this form to open up the scholarship application.

<small>_Please note that all fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required. Everything else is just useful information to us and doesn't factor into the lottery at all._</small>
