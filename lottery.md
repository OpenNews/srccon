Register now for our SRCCON ticket lottery. Note that all fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required. Everything else is just useful information to us and doesn't factor into the lottery at all. If we draw your name in the lottery, you'll be able to purchase a single, non-transferrable ticket for $195.

This is a uniquely terrible bit of text. We need to contextualize the lottery slightly + mention the scholarships.
