Register now for our SRCCON ticket lottery. Note that all fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required&mdash;everything else is just useful information to us and doesn't factor into the lottery at all. If we draw your name in the lottery, you'll be able to purchase a single, non-transferrable ticket.
