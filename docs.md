We'd love for everyone interested in coming to SRCCON to be able to attend, and as the next-best thing, we're offering ways to join in remotely and learn from this year's sessions long after the event is over. This page brings together our remote-participation options, and our growing collection of documentation and also some of the resources we return to again and again as we work to make SRCCON better for all.

## Live Transcripts

Our live-captioning team will be transcribing almost half of all this year's SRCCON sessions—we've [marked them on the schedule](http://schedule.srccon.org/)—and we'll post links to the streaming transcripts on the homepage during the event. You can also install our brand-new [SRCCON Transcript Alert bot for Slack](http://srccon.org/slackbot/) or follow [@srccon](https://twitter.com/srccon) on Twitter for links to transcripts as they go live.

After the event is over, we'll open up all the transcripts for collaborative copyediting and correction to produce a final collection of cleaned-up transcripts.

## Audio & Video

We're experimenting with audio capture this year, and will be posting edited audio from selected SRCCON sessions later this summer, along with a short highlights video.

## Your Writeups, We Want Them

We're looking for writeups of SRCCON sessions, and also for a few writeups that cut across sessions and follow a single theme across the event.  We'll publish these [on Source](http://www.source.openews.org) in August, and here's what we're looking for:

 * 1500-2500 words
 * Conversational, clear tone, aimed at working designers, developers, and data analysts in newsrooms
 * Enlivened by tech details, process descriptions, advice, and/or specific strategies grounded in SRCCON discussions

The ideal writeup is a slightly detailed narrative version of your own SRCCON notes—what you'd tell a colleague about things you learned or processed, with the links and resources you'd want to pass along to them.

Writeups pay $200, invoiced on publication. Pitch us a writeup on a session or a theme by emailing [source@opennews.org](mailto://source@opennews.org)—we'd love your help bringing more of SRCCON's wealth of shared knowledge to a wider audience!
