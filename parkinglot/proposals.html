  <h2>Proposals are closed for 2014</h2>
<p><a href="/sessions">The list of accepted sessions is posted</a>. We are grateful to have received so many excellent proposals, and were glad to be able to merge several similar sessions to get in as many distinct ideas as possible while maintaining topical balance. We enthusiastically encourage everyone who pitched to attend sessions that relate to their proposals and add their perspectives to the discussion.
