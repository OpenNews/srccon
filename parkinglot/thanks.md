Thank you for submitting a proposal to SRCCON. If you like, you can [submit another proposal](/sessions/pitch). If you&rsquo;re all set, please consider inviting your friends to submit a proposal and join us in Philadelphia July  24-25. In particular, please help us spread the word to people who we may not already know about the event.

Reminder: All SRCCON participants, **including session leaders**, need a ticket to the event. If you have a session accepted, you will have an opportunity to purchase a ticket for **one session leader per accepted session**. If you **do** have a ticket and just pitched a session though, right on!
