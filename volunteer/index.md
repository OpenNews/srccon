In addition to leading sessions and general enthusiasm and support throughout SRCCON, we'll need a small group of people to help us keep the event running smoothly. Volunteers will help with registration, supporting session leaders, set-up and clean-up, and those unexpected tasks that come up during an event. If you want to attend SRCCON and are excited about playing this type of (vital!) support role, please [email us](srccon@opennews.org) for information about volunteering.
