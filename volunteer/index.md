<p class="bodybig">In addition to leading sessions and general enthusiasm and support throughout SRCCON, we'll need a small group of people to help us keep the event running smoothly.</p>

Volunteers will help with:

* registration
* supporting session leaders
* set-up and clean-up

As well as those unexpected tasks that always come up during an event.

If you want to attend SRCCON and are excited about playing this type of (vital!) support role, please [email us](srccon@opennews.org) for information about volunteering.
