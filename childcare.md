We are offering free childcare throughout the full SRCCON schedule (including Thursday evening). Our providers are the wonderful [KiddieCorp](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/)  team, whom we welcome back for their third year at SRCCON. Registration has now closed, but [email us](mailto:erika@opennews.org) if you have last-minute childcare needs and we'll see what we can do.

## Our care providers

Staff-to-child ratios range from 1:2 for children 6-11 months to 1:7 for children aged 6-12 years, and KiddieCorp will work with SRCCON organizers to handle registration and logistics so your kid(s) can have a great time while you're conferencing. All caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education.

Two of our own staff members have had their young children happily in KiddieCorp's care over the last two SRCCONs and we were all impressed by the thoughtfulness they brought to every aspect of their services.

## Logistics

Childcare will take place at the conference hotel, which is right next door to the conference venue. You can [learn more about KiddieCorp's staffing](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/staffselect.html) and [security procedures](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/security.html)..
