<p class="big-lead">We offer free childcare for the duration of the SRCCON program and welcome families of all sizes.</p>

# Childcare at SRCCON

We are offering free childcare throughout the full SRCCON schedule (including Thursday evening). Our providers are the wonderful [KiddieCorp](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/)  team, whom we welcome back for their fifth year at SRCCON.

## Our Care Providers

Staff-to-child ratios range from 1:2 for children 6-11 months to 1:7 for children aged 6-12 years, and KiddieCorp will work with SRCCON organizers to handle registration and logistics so your kid(s) can have a great time while you're conferencing. All caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education.

Two of our own staff members have had their young children happily in KiddieCorp's care during prior SRCCONS, and we were all impressed by the thoughtfulness they brought to every aspect of their services.

## Logistics

Childcare will take place at a hotel very close to the conference venue. If you're interested in childcare, please tell us on the [call for participation form](/participation/form/). You can [learn more about KiddieCorp's staffing](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/staffselect.html) and [security procedures](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/security.html).
