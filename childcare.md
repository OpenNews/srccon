We are offering free childcare throughout the full SRCCON schedule (including Thursday evening). Our providers are the wonderful [KiddieCorp](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/) team, whom we welcome back for their second year at SRCCON. Childcare registration is now closedâ€”if you missed the deadline and need childcare, please [contact us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org), and we'll add you to the wait list.

## Our care providers

Staff-to-child ratios range from 1:2 for children 6-11 months to 1:7 for children aged 6-12 years, and KiddieCorp will work with SRCCON organizers to handle registration and logistics so your kid(s) can have a great time while you're conferencing. All caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education.

One of our own staff members' young child happily spent last SRCCON in KiddieCorp's care, and we were all impressed by the thoughtfulness they brought to every aspect of their services.
