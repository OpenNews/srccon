<p class="big-lead">We offer free childcare for the duration of the SRCCON program and welcome families of all sizes.</p>

We are offering free childcare throughout the full SRCCON schedule (including Thursday evening). Our providers are the wonderful [KiddieCorp](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/)  team, whom we welcome back for their fourth year at SRCCON.

## Our care providers

Staff-to-child ratios range from 1:2 for children 6-11 months to 1:7 for children aged 6-12 years, and KiddieCorp will work with SRCCON organizers to handle registration and logistics so your kid(s) can have a great time while you're conferencing. All caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education.

Two of our own staff members have had their young children happily in KiddieCorp's care over the last two SRCCONs and we were all impressed by the thoughtfulness they brought to every aspect of their services.

## Logistics

Childcare will take place at the conference hotel, which is right next door to the conference venue. You can [register now](https://www.jotform.com/KiddieCorp/srcconkids) (please register by May 28) and in the meantime, and [learn more about KiddieCorp's staffing](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/staffselect.html) and [security procedures](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/security.html).
