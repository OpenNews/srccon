title: SRCCON 2019 â€” Childcare
---

<p class="big-lead">We offer free childcare for the duration of the SRCCON program and welcome families of all sizes.</p>

# Childcare and Caretaking

We are offering free childcare throughout the full SRCCON schedule (including Thursday evening). Our providers are the wonderful [KiddieCorp](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/)  team, whom we welcome back for their fifth year at SRCCON.

For the first time this year, we're also offering one scholarship of $500 for caretaking-related costs. (Either to bring your loved ones to Minneapolis, or help care for them back home while you're at the conference.) There is a question on the call for participation form to apply for this scholarship.

## Our Care Providers

Staff-to-child ratios range from 1:2 for children 6-11 months to 1:7 for children aged 6-12 years, and KiddieCorp will work with SRCCON organizers to handle registration and logistics so your kid(s) can have a great time while you're conferencing. All caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education.

Two of our own staff members have had their young children happily in KiddieCorp's care during prior SRCCONS, and we were all impressed by the thoughtfulness they brought to every aspect of their services.

## Logistics

Childcare will take place at the conference venue. You can [learn more about KiddieCorp's staffing](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/staffselect.html) and [security procedures](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/security.html).
