Loosely speaking, our program will feature facilitated conversations and workshops focused on code, data, security, interactive design, newsroom culture, and related topics with relevance to our community. But most of all, we want to know what you want to talk about—and work on—at SRCCON.

Proposals will be published on this site (private form fields excepted), and the sessions we accept will be used to craft the schedule for the two-day conference. SRCCON staff will be available throughout the proposal process, during the run-up to the event, and all through the conference if you have any questions about your session idea or would like support in leading a great session.

So tell us, what’s your perfect SRCCON session? ([Check out the session page](srccon.org/sessions) for examples more detailed guidance on proposing a session.)
