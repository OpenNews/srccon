# The SRCCON Program
SRCCON is a hands-on conference full of peer-led workshops—but the schedule is just where our program begins. [Every attendee is also a participant](/participation) who brings their own interests and experiences into sessions, emergent conversations, our evening activities, and gatherings built around SRCCON.

## Our Sessions
[Sessions at SRCCON](/sessions) are highly collaborative, not a panel on a stage or a speaker running through slides. Facilitators give peers a chance to compare notes, share skills, and learn from each other. We encourage session leaders to think about activities and outcomes—what can attendees take home with them, and how will it change our work? SRCCON is a [genuinely participatory event](/participation), so we look for sessions that include real interactivity and creative formats that support learning.

These sessions reflect the values of this community:

* **We experiment in the open**—by sharing our work and processes, we do the innovative work our organizations need to evolve on the web and better inform our audiences.
* **We support one another**—by offering each other our expertise and empathy, we find new collaborators, help each other learn, and make our networks and organizations more resilient.
* **We lead change**—by challenging the power structures that have failed our industry, we push for inclusive, long-lasting change in our newsrooms, led by journalists of color and the wide swath of journalists outside of NYC/DC.

This part of the program is a mix of work-culture conversations that challenge us to make newsrooms better, and technical workshops that help us build new expertise. You can attend up to 8 sessions over the two days of SRCCON, from about 50 on this year's schedule. [Check out this year's sessions](/sessions).

## Our Schedule
SRCCON is also organized around building connections between participants. We want you to be able to fully focus on taking part—not just in the sessions on the official schedule, but in all the great conversations in hallways and after hours that make an event memorable. So we build in generous breaks to let you chat or grab coffee or tea without feeling rushed getting to the next thing. We provide a full breakfast and lunch both days, with space to chill out or make plans with new friends. Dinner and our Thursday evening program are a chance to spend time with people in more relaxed space.

A schedule that's too full doesn't just wear you out, it leaves no room to connect with new people and ideas. We intentionally create space for you to explore the things you're learning and find collaborators along the way. Here's what our days look like:

**Thursday**

* **8:30AM:** Registration & Breakfast
* **9:30AM:** SRCCON Opening
* **10AM-1PM:** Two 75-minute sessions with a 30-minute break between
* **1PM:** Lunch
* **2:30-5:30PM:** Two 75-minute sessions with a 30-minute break between
* **5:30PM:** Dinner
* **6:30-9:30PM:** Evening Program

**Friday**

* **9AM:** Breakfast
* **10AM-1PM:** Two 75-minute sessions with a 30-minute break between
* **1PM:** Lunch
* **2:30-5:30PM:** Two 75-minute sessions with a 30-minute break between
* **5:30PM:** SRCCON Closing

## Emergent Conversations
We love it when recent work sparks a great idea that travels with you to SRCCON, or a session sends you down just the right rabbit hole and you find yourself among kindred spirits. So we create space at SRCCON for topics beyond the ones on our schedule:

* Lunch signup boards let you choose a room and invite other attendees to bring their meals and join you for a conversation over lunch.
* Activity boards help you plan events outside SRCCON hours, from group visits to a local newsroom or museum, ballgame or concert, or just getting out for some sun and fresh air.
* Jobs boards give you a chance to connect with other attendees about career opportunities, whether you're hiring or looking.

## Our Evening Program
We know [evenings at conferences can be tough](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon-thursday/), so we close the first day of SRCCON with dinner together and an opportunity to have fun, relax, and give our brains a chance to process the amazing sessions from earlier that day. We see Thursday as an opportunity to focus on the "life" side of the work/life balance, with:

* local, guided walks
* hobby workshops & chats
* themed lightning talks
* music & conversations
* a room full of card and board games

Plus, of course, a huge spread of snacks and beverages. We do offer beer and wine Thursday night if you'd like one, but alcohol isn't the focus and there are plenty of delicious non-alcoholic drinks to choose from too. Our snacks are as local as we can get—we love feeling a sense of place wherever we visit.

The Thursday evening program is built and run by attendees, so if you have an idea you'd like to pitch in, [we'd love to hear it](mailto:srccon@opennews.org)!
