<p class="big-lead">Everyone at SRCCON contributes to making it happen. Get ready for our call for participation form, which will be open April 10-24.</p>

# The SRCCON Program

SRCCON is a hands-on conference with two days full of sessions—but the schedule is just where our program begins. [Every attendee is also a participant](/participation) who brings their own interests and experiences into sessions, emergent conversations, our evening activities, and gatherings built around SRCCON.

## Our Sessions

SRCCON is built around peer-led conversations and hands-on workshops. The community members who step up to facilitate these sessions make it all possible. They bring their experience with a topic as well as the questions they haven't answered, and guide conversations and collaborative work that help every attendee head home with new ideas. If you'd like to facilitate a session at SRCCON, we're [ready to support you from idea to execution](#facilitators).

Our program for SRCCON is built around key community values:

* We experiment in the open—by sharing our work and processes, we do the innovative work our organizations need to evolve on the web and better inform our audiences.
* We support one another—by offering each other our expertise and empathy, we find new collaborators, help each other learn, and make our networks and organizations more resilient.
* We lead change—by challenging the power structures that have failed our industry, we push for inclusive, long-lasting change in our newsrooms, led by journalists of color and the wide community of journalists outside of NYC/DC.

## How Do Collaborative Sessions Work?

There are a lot of ways to think about the SRCCON program, but here's the most imporant thing to know: our sessions are highly collaborative, not a panel on a stage or a speaker running through slides. This is an opportunity for peers to [compare notes, share skills, and learn from each other](https://source.opennews.org/articles/srccon-great-conference-sessions/).

We want to make SRCCON a [genuinely participatory event](/participation), and it's hard to be part of a conversation or work together in a session that's mostly lecture. So we look for sessions that include real interactivity, and we love creative formats that support learning. Outstanding sessions might include design exercises, art and games, small-group work, role playing, even field trips—and we're always interested in new ideas.

SRCCON sessions last about 75 minutes, and we encourage facilitators to think about outlines and information density. Overprogramming a session with too many activities can make it hard to reach a satisfying goal—but a session that's underdesigned can easily turn into a conversation between a handful of the loudest people. We're happy to help facilitators figure out the right balance.

## What Kinds of Sessions Can You Attend? (Or Propose!)

Sessions at SRCCON explore cultural questions that help journalists work together better, new tools and techniques that people are excited about, and sessions that meet in the middle, at the intersection of technology and teams. Successful topics often emerge from a single question or problem—if you’ve been struggling with just about any aspect of your work, you can bet others have dealt with it, too. (And session proposers with similar themes sometimes even end up joining forces to present together.)

Our program explores SRCCON's values from all angles. Facilitators might teach new ways of [illustrating abstract stories](https://2016.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-illustrating-investigations) or share experiments with [voice interfaces for news](https://2018.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-voice-interfaces). Attendees might support each other in [managing relationships across teams](https://2018.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-navigating-technical-communication) or developing [healthy practices in remote work](https://2016.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-remote-work). And session leaders can help our community push for change by [elevating data journalism at the local level](https://2017.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-local-data-journalism) and [sharing experiences as journalists of color](https://2018.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-young-journalists-of-color).

We encourage attendees to bring their whole selves into SRCCON, and our schedule regularly extends beyond what you might expect at a journalism conference. Sessions can also extend into topics like [navigating disability](https://2018.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-disability-in-newsroom) and [balancing work with family life](https://2017.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-caregiving-journalism), or hobbies from [science fiction](https://2016.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-media-science-fiction) to [balloon mapping](https://2015.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-39).

## What Does a Session Facilitator Do?

Effective SRCCON facilitation is about effort and preparation more than expertise. Our faciliators plan and guide sessions, ask great questions, share what they know, and learn from their peers. We find that the best sessions are often led by facilitators who:

* have a clear outcome in mind—what you want people to leave with,
* know what they can realistically cover in the time allotted,  
* build a clear outline for the session, but deviate from it as needed,
* actively seek to run balanced, inclusive conversations, and
* make a few simple backup plans in case a session gets a larger or smaller audience than expected.

Facilitators who have a harder time have usually tried to fit too much stuff into too little time, or are underprepared for guiding an active conversation. To give you a taste of how SRCCON facilitators have turned their plans into action, here are some writeups from previous participants:

If running a session sounds like a lot of effort…it is! But it can also be really energizing, and it means that people who are brand-new to the community—or to a topic—can make excellent facilitators if they're willing to put in a little prep time. We provide group and one-on-one support to help facilitators prepare for their sessions, and we can help match you with a co-facilitator if you're pitching solo and want someone to work with you on the ground.

## Our Schedule

SRCCON is also organized around building connections between participants. We want you to be able to fully focus on taking part—not just in the sessions on the official schedule, but in all the great conversations in hallways and after hours that make an event memorable. So we build in generous breaks to let you chat or grab coffee or tea without feeling rushed getting to the next thing. We provide a full breakfast and lunch both days, with space to chill out or make plans with new friends. Dinner and our Thursday evening program are a chance to spend time with people in more relaxed space.

## Emergent Conversations

We love it when recent work sparks a great idea that travels with you to SRCCON, or a session sends you down just the right rabbit hole and you find yourself among kindred spirits. So we create space at SRCCON for topics beyond the ones on our schedule:

* Lunch signup boards let you choose a room and invite other attendees to bring their meals and join you for a conversation over lunch.
* Activity boards help you plan events outside SRCCON hours, from group visits to a local newsroom or museum, ballgame or concert, or just getting out for some sun and fresh air.
* Jobs boards give you a chance to connect with other attendees about career opportunities, whether you're hiring or looking.

## Our Evening Program

We know [evenings at conferences can be tough](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon-thursday/), so we close the first day of SRCCON with dinner together and an opportunity to have fun, relax, and give our brains a chance to process the amazing sessions from earlier that day. We see Thursday as an opportunity to focus on the "life" side of the work/life balance, with:

* local, guided walks
* hobby workshops & chats
* themed lightning talks
* music & conversations
* a room full of card and board games

Plus, of course, a huge spread of snacks and beverages. We do offer beer and wine Thursday night if you'd like one, but alcohol isn't the focus and there are plenty of delicious non-alcoholic drinks to choose from too. Our snacks are as local as we can get—we love feeling a sense of place wherever we visit.

The Thursday evening program is built and run by attendees, so if you have an idea you'd like to pitch in, [we'd love to hear it](mailto:srccon@opennews.org)!
