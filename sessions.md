SRCCON is built around two days of peer-led conversations, hands-on workshops, and skillshares. The community members who step up to design and facilitate these sessions are the ones who make it all possible—which is why *you* should consider [pitching a session now](/sessions/pitch).

## What Makes a Great Session?
Successful sessions often emerge from a single question or problem—if you’ve been struggling with just about any aspect of your work, you can bet other folks have dealt with it, too.

Last year's sessions dealt with topics including newsroom cross-training, CMSes, skillshares on specific libraries and tools, interactive design specifics, diversity in news technology teams, security, the business of news startups, and many different approaches to data-wrangling. To give you a taste, here's [a small selection of great sessions from 2014](#examples).

## What Does a Session Facilitator Do?
Session facilitators aren't expected to be the experts in the room—they design and guide sessions, share what they know, and learn from their peers. You won’t need slides, just the willingness to facilitate an engaged conversation or lead a workshop or skillshare. (Or pitch another session format entirely!)

If your session is accepted, we'll provide as much help as you'd like figuring outwhat kind of session format will work best for your topic—we can even match you up with a co-facilitator if you're pitching solo and want some support.

## How a Pitch Becomes a Session
Session proposals close on Friday, April 10, at midnight PDT. We'll spend a couple of weeks reviewing proposals within the SRCCON team, with additional reviews and perspectives from across our community as we assemble a final list of sessions. We'll notify all proposers about the status of their sessions by Friday, April 24, and we expect to publish our list of accepted sessions on Tuesday, April 28.

As we did last year, we're making it a priority to build a balanced program that reflects the makeup of our communities, and we actively welcome session proposals from members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology, and from non-coastal and small-market news organizations.

**Please note**: If you propose a session that is selected, you will be given a chance to buy a ticket in advance of the public on-sale date, so pitching a great session is a good way to increase your chances of getting a ticket.

## Not Just Sessions…
In addition to the daytime sessions that form the core of SRCCON, we'll also host a series of informal evening talks on non-work topics, open up space for small-group collaboration, and run a hands-on tea- and coffee-hacking station. Stay tuned for more information about additional program items and related events in Minneapolis-St. Paul.
