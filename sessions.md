SRCCON is built around two days of peer-led conversations, hands-on workshops, and skillshares. The community members who step up to facilitate these sessions make it all possible—which is why *you* should [pitch a session](/sessions/pitch). Before you do, though, check out our advice on [how to put together a great pitch and run an excellent SRCCON session](/sessions/great_session).

## What Are SRCCON Sessions Like?

We created SRCCON with a few grounding principles in mind that lay the groundwork for our program as a whole:

* SRCCON is built around participation, discussion, and collaborative problem-solving.
* SRCCON exists to respond to the needs and interests of our community, and we must be intentional in including perspectives from throughout the field.
* Every attendee is a peer—no lecturers, no special status, no outsiders.

Many of our sessions work as structured discussions and problem-solving groups; others function as peer-to-peer skillshares; still others incorporate games, drawing, field trips, and more—we avoid traditional lecture/conference talk formats and classroom-style trainings, but we welcome a wide range of hands-on and collaborative session styles. 

[Check out our guide to pitching and running a great SRCCON session](/sessions/great_session) for examples from last year's schedule and tons of practical advice on what works for our attendees.

## The Selection Process

* **April 20**, call for proposals closes (midnight PDT).
* **May 11**, notification of accepted proposals.
* **May 18**, SRCCON 2016 tickets go on open sale.

 After the call for proposals closes, the SRCCON team reviews all proposals, along with a small group of outside reviewers from across our community. We look for:

  * topics that are relevant to code, design, and data folks in newsrooms (and allied fields)
  * evidence that you've thought through your proposed session topic and format, and what you'd like participants to take away from it 
  * sessions that probably wouldn't work as well at another conference

 We make it a priority to build a program that is balanced and that reflects the makeup of our communities. We actively welcome session proposals from members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology, and from non-coastal and small-market news organizations. 
 
## Co-Facilitators
 
 Many sessions benefit from co-facilitators to share the work of preparation and the fun of running the session itself. As you plan your proposal, you may want to consider pitching with someone from another organization, and/or with a different background from your own—and if you've attended SRCCON before, maybe consider proposing with someone who hasn't been yet. (We won't reject proposals featuring two members of the same team/two SRCCON regulars/etc. out of hand, but we may favor proposals that mix it up.)

## Tickets for Facilitators

SRCCON is a collaborative, peer-to-peer event, and we consider all attendees to be active participants, rather than either speakers or passive audience members. Instead of providing free tickets for session facilitators, we offer need-based scholarships that anyone—facilitator or otherwise—can apply for if they need help covering the costs of attending. (Scholarship applications will open April 25.) This approach also helps us keep ticket prices low enough to be affordable for most news organizations.

We do reserve tickets for the facilitators of all accepted sessions—all facilitators will be given an opportunity to buy a ticket before they go on public sale on May 18.

## Not Just Sessions…

In addition to the daytime sessions that form the core of SRCCON, we'll also host a series of informal evening talks on non-work topics, open up space for small-group collaboration, and run a hands-on tea- and coffee-hacking station. Stay tuned for more information about additional program items and related events.
