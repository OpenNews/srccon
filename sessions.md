The following sessions have been confirmed so far for SRCCON 2017. We thank all who submitted proposals. We have a handful of sessions left to finalize, and session descriptions here will evolve in the weeks leading up to SRCCON. This year's final schedule will reflect these updates and include an evening slate of fun, informal talks, discussions, and activities. We will publish the complete SRCCON schedule in July.
