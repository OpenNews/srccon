Our call for proposals opens March 18 and closes April 8. In the next few weeks, we’ll be posting more information about the selection process, and what it’s like to lead a session. [Check out last year’s schedule](http://2014.srccon.org/schedule/) for a taste of the inaugural SRCCON and a source of proposal-writing inspiration.

We’ll also provide information about our evening programming options, which will range from lightning talks and skillshares to tabletop games and unstructured chill time.

**Please note**: If you propose a session that is selected, you will be given a chance to buy a ticket in advance of the public on-sale date, so pitching a great session is a good way to increase your chances of getting a ticket.
