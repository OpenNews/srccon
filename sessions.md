SRCCON is built around two days of peer-led conversations, hands-on workshops, and skillshares. The community members who step up to facilitate these sessions make it all possible—which is why *you* should [pitch a session now](/sessions/pitch). Before you do, though, check out our advice on [how to put together a great pitch and run an excellent SRCCON session](/sessions/great_session).

Some key dates:

* **March 30**, call for proposals opens.
* **April 20**, call for proposals closes (midnight PDT).
* **May 11**, notification of accepted proposals.
* **May 18**, SRCCON 2016 tickets go on open sale.

## The Selection Process

 The SRCCON team reviews all proposals, along with a small group of outside reviewers from across our community. We look for:

  * topics that are relevant to code and design folks in and near newsrooms
  * evidence that you've thought through your proposed session format, session length, and approach to the subject
  * sessions that wouldn't work as well at another conference
* THESE ARE ALL PLACEHOLDERS BASED ON LAST YEAR'S NOTES

 We make it a priority to build a program that is balanced and that reflects the makeup of our communities. We actively welcome session proposals from members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology, and from non-coastal and small-market news organizations.

## Tickets for Facilitators

SRCCON is a collaborative, peer-to-peer event, and we consider all attendees to be active participants, rather than either speakers or passive audience members. Instead of providing free tickets for session facilitators, we offer need-based scholarships that anyone—facilitator or otherwise—can apply for if they need help covering the costs of attending. (This approach also helps us keep ticket prices low enough to be affordable for most news organizations.)

We do reserve tickets for the facilitators of all accepted sessions—all facilitators will be given an opportunity to buy a ticket before they go on public sale on May 18.

## Not Just Sessions…

In addition to the daytime sessions that form the core of SRCCON, we'll also host a series of informal evening talks on non-work topics, open up space for small-group collaboration, and run a hands-on tea- and coffee-hacking station. Stay tuned for more information about additional program items and related events.
