## Code of Conduct

**SRCCON EVENT SAFETY CONTACT:** If you would like to make any reports, please call (267) 540-3177 or email us at [safety@opennews.org](mailto:safety@opennews.org).

SRCCON and OpenNews are committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free environment for participants of all races, gender and trans statuses, sexual orientations, physical abilities, physical appearances, and beliefs. We've written this code of conduct not because we expect bad behavior from our community—which, in our experience, is overwhelmingly kind and civil—but because we believe a clear code of conduct is one necessary part of building a respectful community space.

SRCCON participants agree to:

* Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert any member of the event team. Reports can be made in person or via the team phone/text line during in-person events, or via Slack or email at any time.
* Take care of each other. Alert a member of the conference team if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

If any attendee engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the conference. (If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should contact the event team with a concise description of your grievance; any grievances filed will be considered by the entire OpenNews team.)

This code of conduct covers the entirety of any SRCCON event. Before, during, and after SRCCON events, the OpenNews staff is available at [safety@opennews.org](mailto:safety@opennews.org) if you see or experience an issue. In addition, during an event you can DM any staff member (Erika Owens, Ryan Pitts, or Sisi Wei) on Slack. During in-person SRCCON events, we will also publicize a contact email and phone number, and point out event staff in matching t-shirts so you know who to contact if you see or experience an issue.

We welcome your feedback on this and every other aspect of our events, and we thank you for working with us to make it a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates.
