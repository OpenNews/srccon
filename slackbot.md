We're excited to be offering live transcription at SRCCON again this year. About half of our 2017 sessions will be transcribed (they're all marked on [the schedule](http://schedule.srccon.org)), and we hope people feel able to take part even if they can't join us in Minneapolis.

We'll [let you know on Twitter](http://twitter.com/srccon) when a transcribed session is about to start, but you can also get alerts sent right into your team's Slack. Add the "SRCCON Transcript Alerts" bot, and you'll get a reminder and a link to the live transcript as these sessions get ready to begin.

**Note:** If you added this Slackbot for last year's SRCCON, you _will_ need to auth it again for SRCCON 2017.

The "Add to Slack" button will ask you to authorize access for a team you belong to, and choose a channel to receive the alerts. That's it!
