We're excited to be offering live transcription at SRCCON again this year. About half of our 2016 sessions will be transcribed (they're all marked on [the schedule](http://schedule.srccon.org)), and we hope people feel able to take part even if they can't join us in Portland.

We'll send out [alerts on Twitter](http://twitter.com/srccon) when a transcribed session is about to start, but we're also trying something new this year: Slack alerts. Add the "SRCCON Transcript Alerts" bot to your team Slack, and you'll get a reminder and a link right to the live transcript as these sessions get ready to begin.

The "Add to Slack" button will ask you to authorize access for a team you belong to, and choose a channel to receive the alerts. That's it!
