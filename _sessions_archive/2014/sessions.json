        "description": "Anyone who’s written for the web has encountered content management systems: complex monoliths of templates, business rules and workflow that take words and media and transform them into the pages and articles our readers see. Anyone who has worked with these systems for long is also familiar with their flaws, their temperamental assumptions about the world, their frustrating constraints, their sometimes-incomprehensible syntax and controls. Even when they work well, they are monolithic systems that represent fossilizations of earlier processes, and are painful to augment and extend.\n\nThis session will be to convene a discussion about what’s wrong with CMSes -- both the systems themselves and the very concept of CMS -- and some possible solutions. What could be possible when we begin to think beyond the CMS as we know it? What systems or protocols could we create that might not be subject to the same problems and limitations? The New York Times R&D Lab will also present some early work showing what an (admittedly futuristic) alternative could look like."

When we first started putting interactive maps on the web, we had only a single toggle between Google’s political and secret-sauce “satellite” view. All the data was proprietary, and working with it meant dropping pins and painstaking line-tracing.\n\nToday, there’s a dizzying array of tools and data sources.\n\nMapbox’s Cloudless Atlas turns NASA Landsat 8 imagery into a gorgeous mosaic. Startups like Planet Labs and Skybox are deploying whole fleets of imaging satellites attached to easy-to-use APIs. OpenStreetMap has reached a million users, a community that contributes and maintains the ever-growing store of infrastructure and road network data.\n\nThe growing competency of frontend mapping tools has made mapping in-browser streamlined. GeoJSON, leaflet.js, easy MapBox hosting, and the all-purpose data-driven-document framework (aka d3.js), have all facilitated the process of \"making a map\" with large amounts of data.\n\nHow can (and should) we use these data and tools in our reporting? And how do we present our findings? In this session we will discuss deeply the world of mapping - with raster and non-raster data, and its architecture in the browser. We will cover strategies and algorithms that make imagery quantifiable, points-of-interest data patterns-of-interest, and ways to load them into the browser for wide distribution via something called the internet.\n\nWe'll break into smaller groups to demonstrate hands-on techniques after our discussion"

This will be a session about ways that statistics can be charted and plotted and how to make sure that we prep our data appropriately for interactive projects. We’ll also run through process models that we might adopt to make fact-checking and peer review an open and organization-agnostic process. Beyond citing sources and licensing intents to prove validity, we’ll talk about how we package information in an interactive story and the protocols for making sure that honest representation is clear and concise in the various vocabularies we use to communicate the news.

Between now and SRCCON, I'll get a GitHub repository up and running so people can contribute dataset tipsheets in simple way, even if they can't make the conference.

The cities are crafting legislation and making hires to engage the community in the decision-making about what public data should be released when and how.\n\nThat process raises many questions. In this session, we’re going to explore those questions and what our role, as journalists/news organizations, should be in the open data movement.\n\nOur goal is to craft a set of guidelines and/or a list of questions that journalists and news shops can use to guide their internal conversations about working with cities and local groups such as the Code for America brigades.\n\nA few topics we’d like to discuss:\n\n* How should we define our relationship with the tech communities / open data enthusiasts? We are experienced at working with government data and understand the challenges, pitfalls and potential power of using it to tell stories about our communities. Should we be lending our expertise and partnering? Or should we remain independent observers and fact-checkers of their work, treating them as another beat to cover? What are the pros and cons?\n* What ethical quandaries might we find ourselves in and how should we define the boundaries? (i.e., participating in beta testing / when and how to scrape government sites … others?)\n* The open data groups have already proven to be a powerful lobby on behalf of freedom of information laws. How should we work with them to ensure that local and state laws continue to be friendly and more open? On the flip side, how should we prepare to mitigate the risks of more restrictive laws being enacted if an open data experiment goes wrong (i.e., backlash against certain information being published or interpreted and published incorrectly?)\n* If we talk of partnering, what are the ways (are there ways?) we can balance our business interests with the open data ethos?\n\nWe’re sure other topics will also come up during our session. We’ll discuss and then document our conversation to help develop a framework for others in similar situations."

In the lucky places with developers who are allowed to work on news projects, these journalists have a litany of common complaints: nobody understands what I do, nobody understands how databases/the internet/computers work, nobody respects how much time it takes to do this kind of work well. \n\nThere are a lot of reasons for this that we won't be able to solve in an hour, but one legacy we need to overcome is the firmly entrenched organization and management structure of the newspaper itself. For 100 years, reporters sat together with their colleagues who covered the same beat. They reported a story, wrote it up and handed it to an editor who read it. He (almost always a he), edited it, demanded a photo or chart to illustrate it, and then handed it to the copy desk to fix typos and place on a page in the next morning's paper. Repeat for another 40 years until you drop dead at your desk. \n\nObviously, nearly everything about our readers and our industry has changed dramatically in the past three decades, but our newsroom structures are remarkably unchanged. In some places, there may be a separate \"digital\" wing lashed on to the side of the org chart, or a \"real-time\" desk that handles web production. In many newsrooms, reporters report (and tweet and shoot video...), write and hand their product off to someone else to put on the web and in print. They are utterly divorced from doing anything online outside of a rigid CMS.\n\nAs journalist-developers, we know how to build apps for the web. We can visualize data and design engaging user experiences on tablet or mobile. In this session, I'd like us to talk about how we can redesign the newsroom itself to upend our clunky workflows pegged to Sunday's newspaper instead of today's news online. \n\nIf you were the editor of your average major metro daily, how would you redraw your organization to make this work?\n*How can we redesign our newsrooms to bring news developers into the reporting process at the beginning and to help everyone else master new skills? \n* Should we adopt Ben Welsh's philosophy that we ought to train web producers to become news devs and not just SEO-experts and explainer explainers? \n* Should we follow Scott Klein's model of making every developer a reporter, designer and data expert?\n* How many AMEs do you really need? \n* Should web producers sit together or with the copy desk and paginators? Should they be in the same room/floor/building/state as reporters and editors? \n* What are the jobs that really need to be done here?\n\nThis exercise is about more than just rearranging deck chairs. Together, we can wipe the slate clean and design a newsroom that builds skills throughout the organization and forces people to think smarter about the internet as a primary medium rather than an afterthought."

It's hard to do all the things in a fast-paced newsroom! \n\nHow can people who code, and people who don't, think collaboratively and holistically about storytelling? NPR's Visuals team is testing one solution: An integrated content team. We come together on projects as coders, designers, photographers and content specialists (reporter/editors). Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nWe can kick off this session with a case study of a project we've built. What went well? What went … less well? \n\nWhat works well and ... less well for you and your team? What are the sticking points for \"content\" people working with programmers, and vice-versa?

(If you do something like this, of course, you hope to find it before you publish.) Just because computers are efficient doesn’t mean they don’t still need solid reporting and editing around just about everything they do.So with that said, what should you watch out for when you or your reporters are working on a data-driven story? What mistakes are especially easy to make, and what can you do to prevent them or at least notice them before it’s too late?This session is about concepts and consequences at a level that helps you ask the right questions of the people actually running your data analysis (which might be you), so the intention is to avoid specific code examples as much as possible in favor of talking through what went wrong—but if the bug fits, explain it!"
