That’s a problem. As media organizations, we’re only serving a fraction of our communities if we can only reach those who already know and agree with the stories we’re sharing. So, what actually encourages people to consider perspectives that differ from their own, and how do we create more space for that?\n\nIn this session, we’ll dig in on these questions and get a little vulnerable as we try to create that space for ourselves. We’ll talk about how people come to believe what they believe, and look at the latest research around confirmation bias, the backlash effect, and other factors that shape how we make decisions and, ultimately, change our minds. In small groups, we’ll talk about areas where our perspectives have changed over time, and reflect on the forces that helped us change our point of view. We’ll surface common themes as a group and discuss ways these experiences could inform and—dare we say—change the way we approach our work.",

Every stage of the news process is an opportunity to engage our audiences, yet in many newsrooms, we only solicit feedback post-publication. User experience (UX) research is a common tool technologists use when developing new products. But it’s applicable to all kinds of newsroom workflows beyond tech teams, from editorial to design to engagement to business development. Creating processes to learn and improve user experiences can lead to more inclusive digital platforms, content, and tools that share information and engage audiences.\n\nWhen is user feedback valuable? Pretty much always: during the ideation, creation or validation phases for content, platforms, tools and experiences. However, at each of these stages, how and why we use audience feedback is subtly different. So, to navigate this process, we will work together to draw a project roadmap that outlines what types of user feedback can be collected at each stage, and what methods are most appropriate. We’ll identify and practice some ways to gather and respond to user feedback. We will also brainstorm audience engagement tactics, such as: usability testing of interactive graphics on mobile devices, focus groups to decide next steps after a story is produced, or co-designing processes for audiences to engage with your organization in new ways.",

But manipulating typography has been an age-old trick of tabloid magazines and sensationalized journalism, so why have we allowed some of these tactics to leak into the realm of digital journalism? Intentional or not, our use and abuse of typography brings up everything from silly snafus, like announcing the wrong winner of Miss Universe, to deeply unethical content that can stir fear and manipulate an audience's point of view.

Having grown reliant on social distribution to reach new audiences, Publishers who had only ever dictated their terms of distribution had to learn to adapt their already-aging business models to walled gardens, new ways to measure reach and engagement, and work within Other People’s Priorities. Content format compatibility issues, maintaining wholly separate designs inside of early-stage platforms with low feature-sets, participation being equally opt-in and required to maintain SEO and reach, reduced ad opportunities, and gaps in analytics...it was a lot to take in. But publishers are doing more than making the best of it: they’re thriving.\n\nIn this session, we’ll look at what we’ve learned from learning to adapt. Your humble hosts will draw from their experience at The New Yorker, Pitchfork, Wired, Quartz, Hearst, Condé Nast, and Vox Media to offer a survey of the technologies and strategies publishers have created to navigate this uncharted frontier. We’ll discuss how our organizations monitor engagement, drive subscriptions and revenue, and balance our legacy systems with the needs these new platforms oblige. ",

Such instances may arise while reporting racially-charged news, and can even present themselves as social experiences within our newsrooms. She identified themes that included feeling tokenized, being completely ignored or being made to feel inadequate. Let us note that such experiences place us in a predicament: our behavior could confirm a bad view of our group and of ourselves, as members of the group. In a book titled “Whistling Vivaldi,” author Claude Steele arrives to a term called “stereotype threat” to describe the pressures we feel in these instances. Expanding on conversations at NICAR, Helga and Michael Grant are inspired to share what they have learned about the mechanics of threats to our identities. Bring your minds to an open space and don’t be afraid to share your truth in this session. We’ll shed light on the forces that cause us bring our own identities into question. We will ask questions that help us think critically about our experiences. We will gather into groups to share and discuss these experiences. We will break-down the contingencies relatable to journalists of color. And we will share and discuss some methods journalists of color can take to reduce the pressure of threats to our identities.\n\nTo maintain a safe space for our audience, this session is only for people of color.",

Everyone will be given a small whiteboard to write their answers.\n\nRound One: Trivia. We will have four categories: local news, millennials, apps, and accessibility. Each category has four questions and you will get 1, 3, 5, or 7 points to wager on each question. The questions will be based off user research and academic studies about how people consume news.\n\nRound Two: Pictures. We will have screenshots of A/B tests from apps and websites of real publications. Players will need to guess which screenshot was the winning one.\n\nRound Three: Numbers. We will ask questions about the percentage of online users that engage in certain habits. The team that guesses the closest correct percentage wins the points.\n\nFinal Round: Guess the pub! We will read five clues (audience characteristics) of each publication. The earlier you guess the publication, the more points you get – but be careful, if you guess incorrectly you'll get 0 points!\n\nThe winning team will get something totally amazing, like tickets to Hamilton or a puppy. This pub quiz is a great way to have some fun, get to know other attendees, and learn something about the people who consume the content we create.

The label read: “put finger in hole.”\n\nFluxus artists were playful revolutionaries who tried to undermine the authority of the museum and the primacy of the artist.  One strategy they deployed was demanding that the viewer complete (and thereby co-create) certain pieces of art.\n\nTo many of us news nerds, “interactive” has become a noun.  But how interactive is your interactive, really?  When’s the last time you stopped to consider just how revolutionary an idea it is to include your reader in the completion (or co-creation) of your work as a journalist?\n\nIn this session, we’ll forget about our newsrooms, tools, and data sets for a while and think about the essence of interaction.  What inspires us as individuals to reach out and try to affect the world?  As part of a group?  By what means can we do so?  How might find we are changed in turn?  What invites us and what repels us?  Where do exploration and interaction diverge?\n\nThen we’ll zoom back in and ask: how can we orchestrate meaningful interactive experiences through our work?  I’ll suggest some inspiration from the art world: happenings, instruction pieces, escape rooms, live action installations; please bring some inspirations of your own.\n\nAlone and in teams, we will hammer out manifestos and instruction pieces for building digital interactives, then swap them with each other.  Take your instructions home.  Follow them.  After SRCCON, we’ll publish the raw materials and the the interactives together as new sNerdFluxkit (2017).",

Indeed, we comfortably sympathize with the views of our political parties, influencers and friends, and ignore the banter; in fact, Fox News viewers believe the news they watch is “fair and balanced”, while CNN watchers dismiss the idea that they could possibly be consuming “fake news.” But why such polarization and how did we get here? If Brexit and the US election teach us one thing, it is that it may be time to step outside our comfort bubbles and start a conversation with the opposing view.\n\nNow suppose you land in another filter bubble full of despisers and disbelievers. How would you convince them that universal healthcare isn’t a bad idea, or that a strong dollar doesn’t translate into a strong US economy? How would you even start such a conversation? For more complicated political and economic issues, how would you help people move forward beyond face value and hearsay? If laying out facts doesn’t work, how can you approach others outside your own filter bubbles with a more accessible, heartfelt or persuasive approach?\n\nThe suggested encounter will not be easy. But filter bubbles won’t burst by themselves. It is up to us to take them on, and we are conscientious and badass enough to pull it off! ",

In this session, we'll work on better understanding climate change issues and on finding new, relatable ways to communicate them. We'll play a game in which we step in the shoes of climate change deniers, beneficiaries, but most importantly of those who suffer from the effects of global warming. Based on our learnings from that, we’ll come up with new ideas for communicating global warming, its reasons, and its effects on people’s lives – through graphics, interactive storytelling, or whatever else we can prototype on paper.",

Not very many great resources exist, testing can be a pain, and just figuring out where to start can leave you scratching your head. Thinking about it in the context of journalism and visual storytelling — where content is dominant and often unpredictable — can be even more confusing. As a result, if accessibility gets thought about at all, it’s often an afterthought. If you’re someone who needs an accessible site, you’re left wandering in an information wasteland.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way! Building accessible content and interfaces — even on tight deadlines — is completely doable. You just have to think about it from the beginning. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of basic accessibility principles, tools, and testing. We’ll then break into groups and look at those principles in the context of journalism — testing some apps, looking at alt text, debating the pros and cons of delivering alternative experiences and and dissecting data visualizations and sites in a way that will help you think about how usable the site really is. You’ll walk away with a sheaf of resources, practical tips to improve your next project and, hopefully, a new understanding of what accessibility on the web can look like.",
