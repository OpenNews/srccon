_This resource is part of the OpenNews After Party toolkit, developed by [Emma Carew Grovum](https://twitter.com/emmacarew). It's meant to help you get the most out of SRCCON—or any journalism event—and share what you learn with your own organization._

_The toolkit is licensed CC BY-SA 4.0, and we'd love to see you use or adapt it for your own event—all we need is a link back here. We'd also be thrilled to hear how you put what you learn into practice, so please tweet us at #OpenNewsAfterParty!_
