## How to use this guide

There are many ways you can make use of the After Party toolkit. You can read through the entire package and decide to use all of the resources we've developed. You might also skim over the entire package and decide to use just one of the resources included here—that's totally fine!

But if you're looking for a bit more structure, we've included the following personas and recipes to help create distinct pathways through the toolkit. Again, these are just starting points and recommendations, and you can mix and match across the toolkit however you like. Take a quick read through the persona statements below. If any of them sounds familiar to you, go ahead and explore the toolkit in the order recommended for that persona.
