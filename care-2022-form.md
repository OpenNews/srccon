# SRCCON:CARE Call for Participation

We can't wait to hear how you'd like to participate at SRCCON:CARE! If you want to attend, facilitate a session, or take part in some other way, this one form is where to let us know. 

If you're curious about how to write your session proposal, [check out this recent guide](https://2022.srccon.org/sessions/proposal-guide/). Sessions at SRCCON:CARE will run in a very similar way. Please feel free to reach out to us at [srccon@opennews.org](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) with any questions. Or if you're all set, the participation form is below!
