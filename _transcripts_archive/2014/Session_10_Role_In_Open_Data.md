     What is our role in the open data movement?
     12:30 to 1:30 p.m.
     Session leaders:  AmyJo Brown and Casey Thomas

     >> Hi.  I'm Casey and this is AmyJo.  I do freelance journalism
here in Philadelphia.  I worked at the Inquirer and the local NPR
affiliate.  The sort of root of this session is -- our sessions were
combined but a lot of these questions we proposed in our sessions and
it's a lot of things I encountered and didn't know the answer to.  The
session title is a question.
     Amy will explain.
     >> I'm AmyJo from Pittsburgh.  I'm a freelance journalist as well
and working on a new start up.  Hopefully announcing it in detail in
the next few weeks.  I came across a lot of questions.  The mayor who
is embracing the idea at least so far, I've been lurking on the open
date group and watching it and a friend of mine that works at the Post
has gotten involved.  Where are the lines.  The open data group had a
conversation.  He's the only news reporter there.  They were like can
we work on that during his work time.  The way they do that is if they
work with the Post Gazette.  There is a lot of resource and partnering
with the Post Gazette.  There were a lot of conversations just around
that.
     And, actually, just this week I was getting in some local pack
files at the county office and discovered the open data group filed to
be a pack.  That raises other questions about reporting involvement
and such.
     What we decided to do, we found a bunch of questions, broad
questions, we wanted to brainstorm where the lines or boundaries might
be.  It's an open discussion and there is no right or wrong answer at
this point.  We wanted to provide context for news rooms.  If you're
wrestling with these ideas, what should you think if you want to be a
beta tester for a city or join an advisory group.
     I think because it's small, do you want to it do one by one?
     >> Sure.
     >> We have post it notes and markers on each table and we'll
start with the first one.  One idea per post it.  You can think, write
down ideas, stick it under the column that you think and we'll do a
group discussion overall about everybody's concepts.
     >> Are we discussing at a table or individually.
     >> We were going to break up into groups but some people may be
by themselves.  So as a group we'll go through and do it one by one.
     >> The first thing we wanted to think about is should we provide
input to government on data releases or data services?  Examples to
think about is if you're asked to be a beta tester or join an advisory
group.  You can think through what might be some pros to being
involved that early on in that process and cons in terms of getting
involved that early in the process.
     Take a couple of minutes, think through, write your ideas on the
post its and then ...




     >> Should we say what our role is, too.  I work for a print
newspaper which is different than mainstream media.
     >> I think when you come up with your idea, you can say this is
why, or this is why I think this is a pro- or a con.  I think your
interesting angles will bring up interesting ideas.
     Give you about one more minute.
     Okay.
     >> This is a little more stacked on the pro side than I thought.
I was asked to do beta testing for the City of Philadelphia and I
initially said yes and then got access to all this data and felt
weird.  It was very informal.  I thought if I take this data now, I
can just report on it.  But I was supposed to provide beta testing and
it got weird.
     On the pro side a lot of these are about informing the schema,
knowing what fields are useful.  What fields would be nice to have and
how that can make someone's job easier.  We might get a field that we
need rather than have him do it for you.
     On the con side.  This one says soul crushing time sink.
     >> You can go around the room and talk about what you put up on
the post it and explain more you thinking.  Let's start with
government really needs that help.  Who put that up there?  Tell us
more about what you're thinking there.
     >> Government really needs to help.  In many government agencies
particularly the ones down to a municipal level, they're using open
data because someone told them they have to but they have no resource,
no budget and only the IT staff they have if they have to time to do
with it.  By the time they produce something, they're land basted by
media or local geeks for not doing a good enough job.  It seems cruel
to me to say do this and do it well, we're not going to tell you what
it means and if you don't do it up to our secret standards we're going
to yell at you.
     >> Anybody else want to share the reasoning behind what is up
there.
     >> When you ask for something, you can tell them to provide
information to you.  You don't get terrible PDF database or something.
     >> Jeremy, you had creates a conflict of interest and I can't
read the example.  What were you thinking.
     >> I think the stuff can be really hard.  And I was imagining a
releasing some dataset.  It's possible to mess it up.  We're
conflicted on reporting on this mess up because we were involved in
it.
     An example that I wrote is if we release information
accidentally, personal identifying information that we didn't intend
to release or didn't anticipate the consequences of and feel bad about
it and complain about it?
     >> I think that is interesting because you're working with groups
of people who are not reporters and don't know our internal code so to
speak on how to do this stuff.
     >> I can give you a really weird very current example.  I work
for the Philadelphia Inquirer, the complicated story is access Philly




this local web entity wanted to keep alive this data archiving
website.  Open data Philly.  In the process it sort of involves the
city.  At some point the city group of -- I don't know what the group
is officially called -- but it's essentially the data evangelists so
to speak.  They wanted to have a meeting of stake holders and I was
already on board.  I got carried over into this city meeting.
Suddenly I'm sitting among mostly government employees as they share
their entire wish list of the hundreds of datasets they want to
release and what stage everything is in.  I'm the investigative slash
data reporting reporter for the Philadelphia inquiry and I'm like this
is where they stand on everything they have a hope of and what is not
here, I know what they never want to release.  And it was like the
most awkward meeting ever.  And then to make it funnier they wanted to
photograph the meeting.
     >> Did they ask you to be off the record during the meeting.
     >> It was so informal.  There were no ground rules set.  I was
sitting next to the head of the group who was getting promoted into
this title.  I'm sitting next to them and they go and photograph
everything.  And now this guy has an investigative reporter next to
him in the shot.
     After the meeting I said to this person, what I wanted to make
sure our ground rules were.  I basically said totally -- I consider
this off the record, I want to help.  I want to get the data out
there.  Please don't say anything gigantic in the meeting like the
mayor is resigning.  Even though it's off the record, it would put me
in a weird situation.  They are supposed to meet again in a month and
I'm wondering 50/50 if I'll be invited back?
     >> What kinds of conversations do you have with your bosses about
that?
     >> We weren't sure if I was going to be involved in the beginning
because it's like how far do we want to go.  The original entity was
not city controlled.  And at that point it was like well the city is
involved but they don't control the website.  Therefore we didn't feel
like we couldn't also be involved.
     And then that's moving a little bit.  This is?
     >> That doesn't have a conversation when the city did become more
involved.
     >> Technically that still hasn't changed but this meeting was
just an odd thing that came up and I wasn't going to say no.
     >> Can I ask a maybe stupid question.  Why is there a difference
between the city involved and a private company involved for you to be
involved?
     >> It really -- it was an open data site, open data group.  The
city's data evangelist was going to be one of the advisers of this
board for the soul purpose of getting a grant piece moving.  Right.
And in the name of helping get open data moving for Philadelphia, it
was my paper, my bosses and I felt it was good to be included and we
were sort of overlooking that part of it.  And it just kind of ...  It
was worth it for the bigger picture.  That was kind of the thinking.
We didn't have it all worked out.  I'm not trying to betray anybody




either but once thaw tell me this, it's like I can't undo this.  Now I
know this list.
     >> Who else?  We have government agencies don't know what is
useful?  Can you talk about that.
     >> It's like what Waldo was saying.  Smaller agencies that want
to put something out they don't have an idea what data to put out,
what format it should be in, what is relevant and what is not.  Sort
of in a side gig in New Jersey I work for this group called hack
jersey and we have a seminar that walled do came and talked about but
they don't know where to start.  It could be an opportunity to say, we
don't necessarily care about some obscure dataset.  These are the ones
you want.  If you're going to put it out here are some things that
would be helpful.
     >> What about on the con side.  It introduced bias.  Can you talk
about that.
     >> Just to build off what you were just saying.  If a government
agency asks a particular person, what format is helpful.  What format
is useful and they get an answer which they might mistake for the
answer.  The other groups are like why did you bring that up?  I want
the raw data or who chose this format.  Everybody has a perspective
and the responsibility of that perspective is something to be aware
of.
     >> It's interesting to see if they go through that process and
there is an advisory group, and they do publish things, is that going
to be a way to make the information or the dataset harder.  So they're
going to say, oh, it's already there for you so we're not going to
answer your request to provide it in another format.  It might be an
out to getting what you really want.
     >> It's setting a precedence of what you want and what you don't
want.
     >> Few more on there.  Anyone else want to share what they put up
there?
     >> Just my con was that if you want to report on the process of
opening data being involved in that process kind of is a conflict of
interest.  Not that I think there's a lot of reporting on the open
data process.
     >> Not yet at least.  But potentially.
     >> I had a pro and it turned into a con.  Particularly for beta
testing.  If you get involved with a beta program early on, you have
connections into the group that is forward enough to think about open
data, the challenging of that can look like bias when it comes out of
beta.  You have networking or friendship connections into the group
that put that together and maybe they're not on the right side of the
issue in the long run.  That can be weird.  Because you're in the beta
testing and you're chummy with the group.  Particularly to outside
resources.  You've been a part of that faction since the beginning and
you're like, I didn't know there were factions.
     >> That's true.
     >> Let's tackle the second one.  The question that we put up
there is what are the ethical quandaries we might find ourselves in by




consuming city data services.  This is the idea of forward recording
or using the apps that we build.  The example geo coding.
     >> This is something that the city opened up a geo coding
service.  Everyone has done geo coding and it sucks because have you
to pay after so long.  But this was free and it's based off the data
that I'm trying to reference.  Yes, they come from the same sources.
It's a perfect geo coding but it's like a city service.  We use city
data all the time but these are sort of new things that cities are
trying to do and I didn't know if it's cool to use it in the app or
not.
     >> If you want to take a few minutes and think through that and
again post any thoughts you might have on the subject.
     >> The two boxes there are quandaries or where you find yourself
ethically.  And the other side is maybe a way to get around one of
those or find some happy medium.
     Another example would be releasing open data in bulk form which
we all use and they release the data as an API which Philadelphia does
a lot.  Would you build an app off a city API.
     That is maybe updated every night as opposed to the data list
that is updated every month or something like that.
     A few more seconds ...
     >> Okay.  Cool.  So this first one is interesting.  It says this
is a problem many places which is fair enough.  Who -- Tom.
     >> I was thinking in most places particularly in New Jersey like
the data is so shitty, this is a dream problem.  An agency that
provides an API or some sort of machinery of data would be fantastic.
I would love to tackle that.  Philly is an awesome example of a place
that is pretty far ahead.
     >> This one says we use city APIs but as a news room we don't
control them.  If they shut them down or apps die.
     >> We have things like our interactive crime map that is updated
every night and all these other pieces.  And if they change something
it breaks the app or if they decide they're not going to do it
anymore, all of our time and energy went into something that is no
longer useful.
     >> Have you talked with the people that maintain it about making
changes to it?
     >> Yes.  We have had some luck.  The other thing sometimes is
there are things that are in there, you know, that aren't very
explainable.  Internally the city knows what it means but what gets
released isn't always like ...  You know.  Some of that is like what
the hell is this?
     >> And then be wary of becoming over-reliant and not examining
unofficial data sources.
     >> That was me again.  I would worry about if the city provides a
service of crime data, particularly if you're doing analysis for a
story and you're like I know this is what I can get from the city.
These are the fields that are available, those are the stories you do
over and over.  And you have to make sure you're constantly looking
for other sources of data and reporting.




     >> The same downfall as them releasing bulk data.
     >> Right.
     >> Potential privacy violation.  For example a New York City
license cab number.
     >> I can speak to that.  This might have been just a New York
thing and I read just one story so I'm not an expert.  We have cabs in
New York -- yellow cabs -- you can reverse engineer, you can reverse
engineer and find out what cab by it was and how much money they're
making.  The technical river that put into obscuring their data wasn't
strong enough.  And I can easily see myself building an entire project
off that and not realizing that flaw wasn't in there from the
beginning.  So something we discussed at the times and began using the
data.  Double and triple checking to make sure it can't be broken by
people who are going to be malicious with it.
     >> Someone from the prior session in the room said the Bangor
Daily News was being sued because of unredacted social security
numbers in it.  The secretary of state cannot be sued for that.  The
Bangor News can.
     >> The risk the cities take on, Philadelphia just had to pay out
$1.4 million because they released the list of gun permit appeals.
And it was up for four days.  And then, you know, they pulled it down.
Everyone that was on that is now getting a small amount of money that
adds up to a lot for the city.  It's funny, the risk isn't all on the
individuals but even the cities are taking risks.
     >> New York had that with shredding of documents and dropping
them at public events.  There were full social security numbers in the
confetti.  People collected it and were able to map out 10 or 15
individuals and police officers.  That is just municipal shredding.
It was like having all of the experts that you have available look it
over and look it over to smoke out potential issues.
     >> I just got that cab data for Philly and it's not -- it's just
raw data.  I wouldn't even have considered the thing that came from
New York because I just don't think about it.
     >> In that case it's easy not to include the license number.  But
if the city already says (inaudible) you might not think that it is.
I can include it so people have a bit more information.  That would be
a problem.
     >> It's interesting, the decisions like we may get public
information but that doesn't necessarily mean we'll publish that
information.  There is a responsibility aspect.  Just because we can
doesn't mean we should.  I have campaign finance data and I want to
map where the contributions are coming from.  Is a city counselor
getting money from his district or is it outside the city.  I got
everyone's home addresses, the registration database and voters
database.  When I publish this I don't want to put everyone's
addresses out.  I don't want someone to reverse engineer it to find
someone's home address.  And that's what we're doing.  We may not have
any control about open data groups but that is an area.  Just because
data is provided doesn't mean the world needs to have easy access to
it maybe.




     >> This is a point where our interest as journalists can conflict
with the interests of open data groups.  Like the tax you data.  I
would trust me with that data but I can see why people don't want it
out for the entire world to know each Cabbies income.  We might ask
for it, get denied and get it informally.  You're working cross
purposes with the open data world if we do that.
     >> Can I ask, this is a vaguely related topic.  I'm coming from
outside the world of journalism.  Speaking specifically to when you
FOIA, they're going out of the way to try toll give me as little as
possible.  I have to question the thoroughness and accuracy of the
data I'm receiving.  Do you assume in an open data movement that the
data can be trusted, complete and accurate?
     >> No.
     >> What process do you employ to interrogate that.  When you're
reporting based on data -- how do you question that.
     >> I think we even had a particular conversation about this with
hackathons, data.  That's exciting.  There is not a lot of necessarily
checking that that data is good data to use.
     Anyone want to speak to the process?
     >> A lot of the open data movement now is about experimenting and
getting data online.  So there's not actually a huge amount of
examples of open data groups using data very successfully, I don't
think.  There is a lot of examples of people doing things with open
data but whether they're changing communities or really making an
impact is debatable.
     Open data now has the goal of opening data not necessarily making
that data useful?
     >> Even verifying, like if you had -- imagine you had to properly
source every row in a table, it's not scalable.  What middle ground is
there.
     >> There is often talking and this hasn't been realized the idea
of open data is a two-way thing.  Not a one way.  The idea of feed
back and the feed back loop is some government agencies are sort of
involved in that but many aren't.  That is definitely a part of the
conversation but it's not happening.
     >> I think it comes down to, for mainstream media when I'm
looking at data, however I got it, I want to go back to the stake
holder who is really going to be their feet to the fire if we write it
up.  And they are probably going to list me because of that.  That
means there is a barrier between me and the government that they're
not going to be super-friendly to me.  Someone from the open data
world that the city might view as more of a partner won't be as
concerned about it.  It doesn't mean if you bring them a finding and
say it looks like crime is up a million percent, they should react the
same.  If they care about the data integrity whether it's ewe or me
they should say that doesn't sound right.  Like bullet proofing for
journalism is take that information back to them before you publish
and verify it and give them an opportunity to say, well you have that
wrong or thank you for telling us this.  We'll fix it.
     Whatever it is.  The same process applies.  You should take from




the journalism world that checklist that is out there.  There is a lot
of them out there and take the parts that are tried and true?
     >> A lot of it is really understanding that data source and
understanding how it's being collected.  If there is something you
don't understand, journalists are often use the phrase don't make any
assumptions.  If there is anything you don't know 100 percent and you
can't say I swear on oath this is correct.  You go back and ask the
question and come back.
     The campaign finance data was incredibly dirty.  The law is not
clear on some practices and county employees interpret it differently,
it was a lot of phone calls to the county.  How are you looking at
this.  And the candidates, how do you interpret this.  And making
notes saying this candidate filed the late contribution reports this
way and another this way.  When we released the data, we normalized it
so you know our process for it.
     >> I didn't put any up because it took a little listening to what
other people were saying to contextualize that.  Now I want to move
that one over there.  And poisoning the well with good intentions and
building off what you're saying.  How do I trust these rows of data
and I think that building like the bullet list, you can end up with a
due diligence area.  What is the best spread sheet you can have.  A
passive pipeline.  311 calls get dumped in there, nobody touches it.
I have to truth.  The last session I was in we were talking about how
that led to a completely bizarre story about the greatest
concentration of graffiti being in a nice neighborhood.
     They publish it and it's like you didn't normalize based on how
many calls per neighborhood.  There are assumptions you're putting in
there.  You might be making someone look stupid who is working to open
data for everybody.  I think that is a kind of ethical quandary
especially if we're talking about the relationships between the
government, open data, and journalists because they all have cross
purposes.  But working towards somewhat similar goals but different
paths?
     >> I was speaking to his point about the two-way thing.  I'm from
New York and I'm working with some of the things that the city has
done recently about opening up the building data.  Now, like you said,
it was all about open data open data.  People want this and that.
People are working towards just opening that data.  But the part which
is now in conversation is about the New York City Department -- open
street map is much more current than their data sometimes.  It's a
question of like if there's a new construction happening, like one of
us will find it before the city.  It gets reported to the city.  The
permits are still going through but the construction is starting.  All
that kind of stuff.  This whole process, the city to have someone go
out there, report it, update the data, that kind of stuff.  The
conversation around, okay we give you all these things, you put it in
there.  How can you feed it back to us.  So the loop of like if
there's a -- so then it speeds up their process.  Something new
happened.  They're going to send someone immediately out there.  If
it's incorrect they stop it.  Like address changes and all those




things.  That happens much faster than the city can do it.
     And another thing is like recycling for example.  In the city,
people are -- on a neighborhood basis.  Somethings are happening.  If
you go to the city's website to get that data, all the current stuff
isn't in there.  How to kind of converge the two so they're informing
each other.  There are other sources that are more current than the
government.  So how to converge these two if someone wants a set of
data it can be as accurate as possible?
     >> Interesting and raises that question of should we be feeding
accurate data directly back to the city.  I think I would struggle
with that.
     >> As long as it's like a two-way exchange.  I'm not sure about
the social security numbers and license plate information, if that
should be exposed and who handles that.  That's a different thing all
together.  But if it's a loop and it's open, like the government is
pulling from the same things, and verifying the correct things.
     >> One of the quandaries I can see being raised is if you're
feeding information back and political decisions are made off that.
How do you -- now you've become part of that process.  So how do you
be transparent about your role and what if you did it wrong.  And now
you're the one that -- now you're reporting on yourself.  The city
counsel is making this horrible decision and they did it based on your
bad work.
     >> Going back to that, getting involved with the government,
just -- there was concern about should you advise them on how to
release data.  Just something like there are a lot of city agencies
and in a city as big as this, they don't talk to each other.  They
have data that collectively would be more than the sum of its parts.
They build these things in Silos.  One ID number here doesn't match
anything here and if those two talk to each other the city's
efficiency would go up.
     One of the things that I see not being a problem at all is for me
to say, can you use one geo code structure for everything.  Can you
guys use one method for tracking, you know, whatever it may be, roads
or city boundaries so we don't, you know, we don't have these data
things that don't connect.
     I have my reasons for wanting the end result but for the city it
helps too?
     >> I think that one thing is also, in our own city I hear a lot
of my community and I would include with us the open data people and
tech outsiders wanted to love their city making weird assumptions that
I think are unfair.  I think we can attribute maliciousness or
stupidity when it's a giant old system built in pieces by a million
people over time.  And have a respect for that inefficient balance.
Sometimes if you shout loud enough, this is really important and you
have to do it, they're going to be rebels.  Now we're dealing with, oh
gosh, any Chicago peeps?  We swished our transit payment system to
this awful thing.  Someone is like it should be this way and it's
going to be this wristband thing and it wasn't that great.
     I have a police detective friend and they were switching to, they




wanted more transparency in cops hours.  These cops with bad.  They're
not working the hours they're charging for.  They started buying this
time card system and it was going to just throw awful wrenches in
everything.  It was going to require precise, really precise note
taking on lunch breaks.  And like okay, who cares?  Well, if I like
don't get -- if I didn't have my supervisor approve my lunch break
change in the system, then it couldn't go in.  We always have to be
flexible.  Everybody is doing that.  If you have this many cops and
this many supervisors we need to hire three more supervisors to
approve lunch breaks and if we don't hire them.  I can say I was
taking a statement and at lunch at the same time.
     So like we don't have the whole picture and I think that
humility.  This might not be the answer but this is what this looks
like or would this be asking questions other than yelling should be a
priority?
     >> Should we be demanding, we as a community, certain kinds of
data, because hey, it would be cool to have that data but there are
consequences of collecting that data.
     >> I think it's your ratio of listening versus shouting and
cultivating a healthy balance.
     >> That is a lead in to the next question.  There are going to be
open data projects.  It's a new thing and you have new people coming
in that are going to go wrong.  We've all worked with crime data and
how messy it is.  And the differences if you're scraping something and
saying there is a lot of a particular crime in a neighborhood but it's
not coded correctly and whatnot.
     We want to get thoughts on what do we do about a project that
seems to be going wrong.  Or the brigade publishes crime data and we
know it's flawed but it's getting a lot of attention in the community
because it gets people sort of looking at that data and drawing
conclusions from it.  What do we do?  Should we be diving in to help
them fix that.  Critically reporting on the pieces that they're
putting out there?  We want to take everybody's pros and cons to
either of those strategies.
     I'm going to give you a few minutes to think through that.
     >> I like the little illustration.  This is cool, too.  Right on
the line there.
     You put up a bunch of cards.  Do you want to go through your
thoughts?
     >> So for a con, I think about maybe there is some criterion for
when it's necessary.  What is the consequence of this?  Is it like,
oh, I know this and you don't?  Or is it, our government should not
make a decision based on this because I something I see and you don't.
     I think that it feels like this is new and fragile.  Hearing like
you're going to do it wrong will scare a lot of people out of trying
from all sides.
     So in general, like, how can we help each other until maybe we
mature and then we can go at each other's throats when it's a fair
game.
     And then the sailboat, thinking about people's time and doing




something in an efficient way that you can learn about whatnot to do
and you can tell on yourself and do it in a spirit.  I can say like
it's a lot easier to say you did that wrong if you're like here look
at this page where I really screwed up and what I had to do.  And
then, yeah, so the boat is for like the rising tide.  I don't remember
the stupid adage.  Raises all the boats.  If stuff is hard and there
are a lot of got yeas, nobody is going to think of all of them.  We
have to make it okay to have an addendum to this story.  New
corrections.
     >> The threshold for intervention.  Is that yours as well?
     >> Yes.  I started with that, just like thinking about is this
important to act on?
     >> Would that be even going maybe to a hack -- or a weekly meet
up and sitting down and spending time.
     >> I think I was thinking what are the consequences of this
mistake?  Is this worth my time and publicly shaming someone?
     >> Right.  In Philly there is a part of code for Philly and they
have a weekly hack session and there are 25 to 30 people there a week
working on things and it's a good opportunity to show up and not try
to be expert-ish but sit down.  A lot of these things are focused on
building something and not spending time fixing data because it's not
as fun to do that.  Well, some people think it's fun.
     Someone has critical reporting.
     >> That's me.  On the side of reporting on projects that are
misusing data.  There are two prongs of it.  Right.  One going back to
the organization, next time you do this you can do this a little bit
better in a sort of thanks for the data, this was a good attempt
phrasing.  And the other is like educating the public about stuff.
The project came to me like any of the mug shot websites.  Yes, you
want to see this but does it help you.  You know this is available but
what does it serve as a public good to create something that is
ethically riff just because we have the data for it.  People reporting
on open data projects and whether or not they were used well or
whatever is more the fact that it's out there and people can read it
and address their questions that they want to see their government
reporting about or their groups reporting about.
     >> Right.  And then Jeremy, conflict of interest.  It is news but
it could endangerer our ability to report news, question mark.
     >> Maybe the solution is since we understand the conflict here,
is to try to report on it in a way that doesn't look at how awful this
is or how much better, it doesn't work great this time but it could be
better, that kind of angle.
     >> I guess I see what physically going to these groups and being
like hey, what do you think about this?  And working through the
people there.  I mean so many of these things like the New York City
taxi thing got a million hits.  But there's so many that don't get any
traffic at all.  Spending time like ...  I think you want to get as
close back to the root of the problem.  So go and fix it in the fourth
release but you have no idea if it's going to be popular.  Maybe you
write a story about the taxi identification but it doesn't get as much




traffic.  I don't know ...  So ...
     >> I think there's also the we're smart but we aren't necessarily
the expert.  Say someone did something and you're like, whoa, they
didn't think about this or they didn't write about this caveat.  Maybe
they did think about that stuff.  Even if you're going to report, you
still have to talk to them and see what they did and why they did it.
     >> That's true.
     >> I was going to say if there -- Tom, if you want to comment and
if anyone has questions that you're burning with for the group, let's
end the remaining time and talk about that.
     >> I was going to say the nice thing in a lot of places outside
New York, these communities are pretty small and rarely does anything
come up that is a big surprise.  There are opportunities for open
source projects for something coming down.  You can file a HIB issue
and say I've worked with this crime data, be aware of this or have you
thought about that.  I think it's fair to raise those questions while
something is in development.  And like wise if you're going to report
on them, it's not a surprise to those people.  They're going to know
that you're watching and you're going to go to them.  I don't think
anybody wants to feel like they've been mistreated but if you write
the story and you're forthcoming with them, okay, here are issues that
came up, let's talk about it.  I think it's fair to work both sides.
I don't think you need to be a core contributor but if you have
reporting and expertise on them, you should ...
     >> How do you -- the historical reporting.  Copying a dataset and
you're responsible for what comes out of the dataset.  How do you keep
up with the data as it moves from story to story using one story for
another.  How does that echo down the pipeline?  It becomes
de-normalized and nobody is trying to track this story which is
related to this story that reports on this story tracks back to this
open data source.
     >> That is something that I'm working on in Pittsburgh.  It's
something we're looking to build.  I'm collecting all the campaign
finance data.  Do we want to update that for every report.  We get to
a point where we're collecting enough data and we have the historical
record.  You can look at the funding in this campaign back in 2009 and
compare it to the 2013 campaign and have that record.  But we don't --
we're still mutilating and talking through how do we ensure that is
maintained and when you up load the data that it matches the data that
you've already got.
     I don't know answers but it's something that we're noodlating, at
least starting to think about.
     >> Was that word "noodling"?
     >> Noodlating.
     >> I think of words all the time.
     >> I think it's important to document, I got this data from this
source and here is the process that got me to this story.  And the
more open you can be about that, the better it's going to be for
anyone who take it is story further and it's great for yourself and
the organization.  Really starting at the source level and going each




step of the way.
     >> Any other burning questions someone has about open data or
working with open data groups?
     >> I'd be curious about the line between, going back to some of
the underlying questions, reporting on open data efforts.
Particularly ones that end up -- there is a lot of developers that go
and do their own projects.  But commenting on projects you see or the
projects that you're working on on your own.  The line between when
you're reporting on a project based just tech upon your tree, you have
personal developer problems about how a certain group provided data
compared to like it's building into a story and reporting.  And
walking that line just so you aren't conflicting with your own self
about it later on if something turns into a full story versus all of
the opinions you spatted on Twitter about it.  I don't know that I've
seen a lot of people walk that enough to say I have a good sense of
what that is.
     >> Any thoughts.
     >> It might be a total dead end question and that's fine.  I was
just thinking about it.
     >> Casey you're on the other side.  You work for the government.
You have the whole perspective.  You've done freelance, you worked for
the Inquirer and done other things what was it like when you worked
for the city and saw it from the other side?
     >> I mean, yeah ...  Philadelphia is such a big city that it's
hard to find larger groups that are aware of these things.  It's
mostly one or two people in the department that even care.  And maybe
they have a relationship for open data and are really excited and talk
to their boss.  But at the time I was working for the city it was --
open data wasn't that big.  And a lot of the data stuff, there was
data out there but there wasn't the open Philly.  It was too messy.
It wasn't a big campaign like it is now.  I feel like people in this
city have a good idea what is going on and what it means.  Not that
they're all sold on it.  I remember requests for Pennsylvania law on
the other side and the lawyers being like do we have this exact thing
as they word it here?  No, but it would take five seconds to do a
query but we don't have it.  I don't know if that sort of initial
response kind of thing has changed.  Just because it seems like the
city is getting more comfortable.  Our chief data officer left because
he ran into department heads not wanted to release more important
datasets.  They released bike rack locations.  That is great, it's
easy.  It's useful to some people but what about the salary data or
police internal affair investigations.  It's at that point where we
have bigger and more important datasets in the city and it got to a
point where it's more about politics than technology.  These things
are being built but blocked because the city doesn't want them out
there.
     My time with the city, people didn't really know or care.  We
would respond, we had better luck doing it informally at least at the
water department?
     >> At one point we wanted to do something with water usage at the




parcel level.  It was something about city vacancies and the thinking
is if there is water usage there is somebody there.  But the city
couldn't give it to us.
     >> I know I gave chunks of it to students and stuff like that.  I
don't know, I mean it probably hasn't changed that much.  I had better
luck doing informal requests at that point and that seems to be one
advantage that journalists have over mainstream media is that we then
can often turn to this back-door route.  Which is a little unfair
because we're supposed to be just the public.  But sometimes
government agencies work with the media if they feel like, you know,
there's something -- whatever their motive is.  The average person may
not think to go that route or have the ability.
     >> So we are at time.  What we're going to do is take the notes
from the session, it was being transcribed and we have the notes from
the post its and we'll create a document and organize it so it can
spark conversations in the news room.  So you can see where we fell
with pros and cons and hopefully that can help you talk through
working with open data groups.
     We'll release that later.
     >> Thank you so much for coming.
