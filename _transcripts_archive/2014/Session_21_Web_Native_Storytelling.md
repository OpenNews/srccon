Toward web-native storytelling!
Session facilitator(s): Claire O'Neill, Tyler Fisher
Day & Time: Friday, 11am-12pm
Room: Franklin 1

>>Morning, everyone:  So this session was originally called "Cool data bro', but what's the story?" and that seemed kind of mean, so I changed it to web storytelling, whatever that means.  So I guess we can introduce ourselves first.  What we're thinking of doing is we'll introduce ourselves, we'll talk a little bit about our team, and we can sort of talk about a project you did, but then we thought it might be interesting to sort of talk about our design exercise, basically the exercise we do and then break into groups and do that design exercise for a story.  

So who am I?  I'm Claire O'Neill, I work at NPR on our visuals team.  Yeah, so I've been at NPR for about five years, I started as an intern, at the time the only department doing internet was like, well, we had web producers basically filling out radio stories and then radio team.  But so I was there for about five years, and somewhat recently our boss at that department left and Brian Boyer was hired to start a news apps team, and so at that point, our teams merged and so now we're sort of a content team of designers, photo editors, and my role is sort of more of an editor sort of content strategy.
>> I'm Chris Groskopf.  No, I'm Tyler Fisher -- I just started this month and I'm a designer developer on the team.  I also started as an intern and was hired, and I, you know, I think a lot of people assume, like because I sort of do news apps development that all I care about is data, and I just want to make charts, but I find what we do at NPR a lot more rewarding because we're telling stories with really inventive amazing visuals and trying to find the best way to tell a story, not just assume that a bar chart will do the job.  So I will be in the session to make that a more systemic thing in our field to think about what the story actually is and how it needs to be told.
>> How many people here are on similar teams like that?  Yeah, where do you work and how does your team work?
>> I'm an intern right now at FiveThirtyEight, so a lot of our visuals are just charts and line graphs and things like that.  We usually have one larger interactive, for example, like the World Cup interactive, and the majority of stories are told using charts.
>>
>> Who else?  What about you?
>> I'm at ProPublica, it's like a small news application team, so that's designers and developers and kind of everybody is both a reporter and [inaudible].
>> Are there any like photo or video editors on your team?
>> There's a new design director.
>> Who else?
>> I'm on the interactive news team at the New York Times, and we it's kind of like we don't have photo and video editors on the team, but we work with the editors that are actually on the separate desks.
>> So how does that work?  Say you've got a project you're working on, what's your process?
>> Um, it changes a lot.  I can't really speak for every team there, but certainly it would usually sort of end up that we will create a prototype and then show that to the desk and then work with them and then work with our news design team, because the interactive news team is very developer heavy, it doesn't have designers on it, so we then work with designers to make the prototype that we've created into something actually worth using.
>> So I guess the way that Brian, our team leader, describes it is we're sort of like the backup end.  We consult reporters who are like our lead singers.  Which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.  Steve Inskeep, who's the host of one of our radio shows, Morning Edition, was going to be spending two weeks on the US-Mexico border, so we had -- we went into the planning meetings and sort of like spitballed a bunch of things, wrote them all down on the wall, asked a bunch of questions:  What is the point of this reporting trip?  And the thing that we ended up circling at the end is, "What does it feel like to be there?"  That's it.  And then simultaneously, CIR came to us with a bunch of data about, can you describe like sort of --
>> Yeah, so actually I don't think I saw the actual map, but so CIR had data basically they'd done one thing where they had basically gone and mapped the entire like fenced border between the US and Mexico, where the US had put up some sort of obstruction between the borders to prevent people from crossing, to prevent livestock from crossing, all these various things, and it's not all that well documented, so they pretty much had to go out and map out where everything was, and also, you know, categorize the different types of fence, because it varied wildly, between, you know, San Diego, and you know, El Paso.

>>  They had very, very different fences.  So we wanted to sort of look at -- or they wanted with the map to look at that divide, and that was data-driven way of looking at how this border is constructed, but we also had, you know, Steve Inskeep, there hearing interesting stories, a much more interesting way to tell a story about the border that's more inclusive and much more encompassing.

>>  Before CIR had done that -- I mean this is the most thorough documentation between where there's fence and where there's not, you can drill down to like street view.  So we had another brainstorming session, one idea was let's make it an interactive map, we've got a photographer there, let's have them shoot every kind of fence that they encountered along the way.  There's like 12 different kinds of fence.  Maybe we can have people explore this map and see the differences along the way, so our photographer was there with Steve Inskeep for two weeks.  She started -- this is the thing that caught my eye off the bat.  She sent this pictures which seemed real -- toothbrushes, which seemed really unusual.  All of these objects and artifacts had been left behind.  These just seemed like such an interesting way of getting at the people and the sort of humanity behind the story, and so we're like OK, we need to rethink how we're going to do this.  So we took over a back room in our office, and basically started storyboarding it almost like a magazine.  And well, this is the mobile view.  So we've got a series of stories here.  One leads to the other.  They each work on their own.  But together they sort of create this story about what it feels like to be on the border.  We also had this data about traffic.  

[Inaudible] [we're having technical difficulties in the room and the captioner can't hear the speaker]

>> So we had some internal debate about the ordering of these stories.  This is what we ended up doing with all of the map data.
>> Can you zoom out a little bit?
>> There we go.  Thanks.
>> So it was really interesting talking to the CIR, like Mike Corey who works there, and Matt Stiles was, working on this and hearing them talk about the fence was just so much more interesting than seeing the map.  So we were like, OK, let's just sit in a room and talk about all of the fence facts and distill, you know, the most important things we need to know, and then do it in this larger format, and that entire sort of.  And this is our attempt to sort of like walk the reader through it, sort of like narrating data, narrating graphics, mirroring the text to the images.  There's a million things that don't work about this project, but this is sort of like our first step toward -- I mean you can see this is glorified photo editing, which works in some ways and some doesn't.  But it's at least -- it's talking to the data and putting it out in a story.
>> So yeah, I mean ...  So yeah, so basically like the idea behind this project is it cribs a little bit from classic photo editing.  Basically when we're training people how to edit the photo gallery, we say that there's like five steps to telling visual narrative, we have a wide establishing shot, you're closeup detail, your portrait, your detailed shot and your action shot.  And so the idea is that the story.

>>It's a story about the Ethiopian woman, $15,000 in five years to reach the border.  

ROOM WRANGLER:  We're trying to get somebody to turn on the microphone, but it's not likely and we're trying to get the white noise turned off, but that's not likely, either.
SESSION LEADER:  Right, so we zoom in on a person, a human who can sort of connect it us to the story and then we have a few detail shots of you knee know, recipes on border and then some action shots, you know, a story in essay proceedings speak about an actual episode that they had border control.  Some things were cool about this, some things weren't, but this is sort of our team's first collaborative project together.

How many people are on the team and what were the roles that they played in helping you build this?
>> So our team in general or the team that worked on this.
>> For this project in particular.

>>  So that's really interesting.  Steve Inskeep is, let's say, the lead reporter.  We sort of called him our content specialist, but what was really interesting.  He reported 20 stories for the radio, gave us all of his reporting but then sort of stepped back and allowed us to write what we needed for the web and became our editor basically.  We went to him and we said, you know, there is we weren't there, tell us what it was like, otherwise we're going to write a few essays about these photos, we're going to write a little story these toothbrushes and do our own reporting on that.  Can you edit it?  So that's how that works.  The only photographer on this was with Steve two weeks straight, shot everything.  I worked with designer Wes Endamood (?)
>> Yeah, so after they storyboarded, they came back with sort of an idea to do this sort of slide format.  Wes and I worked for I think a week or two, it was just the two of us mostly, working on just making some sort of prototype of the border, not really all the content of how this is going to function from a technical perspective.  We went through a bunch of iterations.  The first initial thing we did was we were trying to incorporate a way where the stories were stacked vertically and you would scroll through each story and more none vertically for each story.  We found that was really difficult to just like wrap your head around where you are.  Because you can leave a story and then come back to it and halfway through it, wait, what happened?  I don't know where I am.  So we found that just putting it all in one long slideshow, even if it felt a little bit like, oh, we're just making a slideshow, but not really, because we're doing so many things with slide on and aspect ratio, and then it got to the became a little more technically challenging.  We pulled in who was supposed to be doing the session.
>> We worked on it for a few weeks, had a few iteration views, and I mean what's interesting about this is this only happened because Brian Weir was out of town.  Like basically this is what happens when people like myself and the photographer were like let's do all of these things with all of these photos, you guys can build that, right?  Which is problematic.  I mean this has been a learning experience in sort of learning better what Tyler and Chris could do in a reasonable amount of time, so yeah, I mean I feel like I don't know -- the story of my experience, and NPR and at conferencing, I feel like I'm like forcing my way in.  And trying to learn better.  
>> So I'm curious about sort of the project management aspect of it.  Because you were working with this other team as well as your own reporters, so you were really kind of working with a lot of different people.  Did you do weekly meetings?  I mean how did you kind of coordinate that all and kind of keep it rolling at the same time with everyone knowing what their tasks were and their deadlines and all of that?
SESSION LEADER:  Yeah, a lot of meetings.  And product management was sort of a coteam.  Becky Lettenberger who also was on my multimedia team of photographers and videographers, she doesn't quite know how to product manage data reporters just yet, so they were sort of managing it together, but we would have weekly meetings?
>> Yeah, we had weekly iteration reviews that we meet with everybody on the project, including like Steve Inskeep would come to the meeting and see our progress.  Also Brian when he was around would also get involved.  So that keeps us in check and plans out and we work for the week and then what we get done, we present it and move on from there.  It allows us to you know, pivot when we need to.  If something didn't work.  OK, let's try this week, see if that works, go down this pathway.  Yeah.
>> What was the total time start to finish on it?
>> Let's see.
>> Four weeks, yeah?
>> So in terms of the work flow between producers and writers and videographers, and photographers, how was that set up?
>> Through a spreadsheet.
>> So it was all driven like so you just edit the Google spreadsheets and it loads in.
>> Yeah, so the developing had to -- it's not running live on the spreadsheet, but so every slide is its own row of instruction and -- can we move on to the session?

>>Yeah, unless there are other questions.  I didn't mean to dwell on this so much, but yeah.
>> Why did you choose to do a [inaudible].
>> Because if we put this into scroll you would be scrolling forward, and also, I think like we thought about it as a magazine and we're kind of focusing on one thing at a time.  And we're.
>> So it's a gut level how you want to work the story?
>> Yeah.  I mean it was an experiment in sort of like revealing bite-size parts of the story one at a time.  What's interesting is the time on site for this was, I think 22 minutes, which is how long it takes to get through the thing.  The other that's interesting is there's a little video in the middle, and very few people watched it.  And, yeah, I think it cribs a little bit from magazines in that way, but where it's different from magazines is like, so we played with layouts a lot.  In this section of portraits, and I feel like this is still a little magaziney in the way that it's laid out but we had these cropped as vertical photos with a quote on the side and that just feels too much like print so we tried a few ways to make this feel more webby and internetty, and this feels a little bit better, but it's still not quite there.
>> So it seems like before Steve and the whole crew went to work on the story, you guys got to work with them before -- so is that how your projects normally run where you get to work with the team before they actually start to take pictures or like write the story?  Or you know, or is it like the other way around where they'll come to the story and like hey, we want something made for this.
>> It's a little bit of both, but the tides are changing there a little bit so that we're there at that very beginning brainstorming part of reporting.  Which is really important.  I think I'm going to do a story on this thing, they'll come to us, and we'll be like that's awesome, that's an incredibly visual story and we should do that with photos or we should do that with a map and then like we'll go into the field with them and we'll collaboratively report it.  What was awesome about this is when Steve would edit it.  He's a radio reporter, but he had awesome things to stay about how to tell the story and how to pace it and what words to use.  So that was really important.
>> In terms of being able to focus on just this piece, are there any other stories going on at the same time that you have to work on or are you just mostly focused on whatever is in front of you.
>> Our team is doing a mix of daily and feature content like this, so for the most part, I was focused on this, but like one of our designers is pumping out maps and graphs every day.
>> I think we smartly divide our work in a way that ally is responsible for the daily requests and if she is overloaded we can put some work on somebody else.  But she is the first contact.  She can almost always handle the work that comes in.  So that allows us to plan at a more macro level.
>> Move on to --
>> Yeah, so what might be interesting is we'll shut up.  So we're going to be working in the next few weeks on a story about homeless veterans.  There are, I think, approximately 60,000 in the US.  I think about 8% of those are veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan.  So it might be interesting.  I think we should break into groups, but first let's do our design exercise which I do at beginning of every project like this.  OK, we're going to do a big project on home less vets, so we have to ask a few questions.  The first one who's the audience?  ...  Second question:  What are their needs?  In other words, what are the main questions we need to ask and ask answer for our audience and then how do we make it work?  So why don't we do the first one as a room and talk about who could be the potential audience for a story about homeless veterans, and then we'll break into smaller groups, each group will have a different audience and you guys will answer the next two questions.  So who could be the audience for a story about homeless vets?
>> Other veterans.
>> Policymakers, maybe.
>> Social service workers.  Family members.
>> Community members, like local.
>> Yeah, people who pass the homeless vets on the streets every day.
>> Anyone else you'd want to target?
>> Could people who aren't aware of veterans issues, because it's a public issue that they should be aware of, so people who don't know very much about the topic.
>> People who don't know about veterans issues in general?
>> Mm-hm.
>> The homeless folks themselves.
>>
>> Interesting.
>>
>> I have a quick question.  Would you typically do this with any type of data or research?  Are you trying to answer these questions based on your own assumptions?
>> Say it again?
>> Would you typically back up the answers to these questions, who's the audience and what are their needs with any type of research or data, or are you basing these answers in and the way you approach the project based on your own assumptions and sort of what you think?
>> So like if we like have a set of data, do we then ask these questions?
>> No, do we have data about what homeless veterans, like how they get media?  Is that what you're asking?
>> Well, I mean --
>> Like, how can we get to our audience?  What sorts of things are they using that would be --
>> Yeah, so these are, you know, this is a good list of potential audiences, right?  And if we move on to the next question, what are their needs and we start to answer that, just out of our brain skulls, we are making wild assumptions, right?
>> Yes.
>> Those might be right or wrong occasionally, but we're not potentially actually learning anything that's going to help us make a better project.  It's maybe going to help us brainstorm, but it's potentially dangerous assumptions if it's not backed up by any kind of research or data.
>> Well, let's go down there.  Let's do an example.  So let's say we want to talk to people who don't really know about veterans issues.
>> OK.
>> So what are their needs?
>> We don't know.  We need to talk to them:
>> But then if you took and said what do you need to know about veterans issues?  They're not going to know, so it's -- it's difficult, right?  I mean you --
>> What are the needs is probably the kind of the wrong way of saying it, but it's like what do they need to know.
>> Yeah, they'll need more context.
>> a degree of awareness there's a problem, right, like some statistics that set up a scene.
>> I see what you're getting at, like is this a backwards way of doing it.
>> Is the answer to who's the audience ever like let's look at demographic information of who lives in the center of Peoria?
>> It's just is sort of the ethnographic research, the early stage interviewing about with users, about their actual needs and understanding, those sorts of things.  Are typically put on the wayside, and we do this sort of work in the abstract and then we move to start making things and then we sort of measure -- do qualitative research while we're doing user testing and stuff like that, but potentially we made the wrong thing because we didn't really understand what our users needed or wanted.
>> So what would be a better way of doing it?
>> Well, I mean you might -- you probably wouldn't do that at a project level, right, for something like this that you have to turn around in a he can week you're not going to be able to put together a fly on the wall investigations of user needs of very specific sets, but I think there is probably organizational level and brand level work that you can do on that, that you can start each project with.
>> Yeah, I mean NPR has a wide swath of data and statistics on NPR.org users, how they're coming to our content, what they're looking for, statistics about them.  I've been actually pretty impressed by the service that kind of handles that for us.  That's something that we always have at the back of our heads, like who's coming to NPR.org and I think that helps us when picking whether to do stories at all.
>> I feel like in a way this is very similar process to how reporters will craft stories, right?  So part of it's intuitive, part of it is built from experience and kind of knowing what stories resonate and how that story gets put together, because data is great and it can inform a lot of things, but there's also a way of kind of telling people something that will grab their interest, you kind of have to surprise them, you have to do something they don't expect, so they're not going to feed you the exact information you need to build that.
>> Well, you wouldn't expect that in a human centered design process, either?  Right?  You wouldn't be able to expect people to tell you the thing that they don't know that you would make, right?  The data is about informing your next step and whether it be qualitative or quantitative data, right?  I'm not saying we need heavy demographics.
>> Yeah, I think if the time is there and the right opportunity is there, learning about your audience before you start is invaluable, but I think when we're doing two-week projects, this is as close as we can get this.  Exercise for us is as close.  It serves as a design constraint for us so we don't get feature crazy.  We're thinking about this audience, let's think about what we can build for them instead of building for everybody.
>>It's part design exercise and part storyboarding exercise.  For me what's helpful about this, is it puts a person in my head like a person, OK, I have to explain this to my uncle Joe, so how do I do that?  So it's less like, you know, -- it's just an exercise, yeah, but I think that's -- you're raising an interesting point.
>> But maybe it's worth continuing down this rabbit hole, like let's try it.  So why don't we listen -- let's do this for ten minutes:
>> I had a question about the process.
>> So you -- do you narrow it down from there or -- [inaudible]
>> Yeah, yeah.
>> So the next part of this is we can probably use it by table, right?  So by table you're going to get one of these audience groups and you're going to decide whether what you need to make a story about this.  And this is a story about homeless veterans.
>> Yeah, so let's say this is a story about homeless veterans, you have to relay information to a specific audience.  You have access to any dataset that's relevant, and you also have a photographer and a reporter.  Just to give some context, I was in San Diego last weekend at an event called stand down where San Diego VA brings veterans in off the street, convenience them up and we did a lot of portraits.  OK, so you guys want to join forces.
>> Let's say Group 1, you're talking to homeless vets.
>> You look pained.
>> Homeless vets don't have devices.
>> Yeah, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.
>> Group 2, other veterans.  Group 3, family members.  Group 4, let's do policymakers, group 5, people in the community and group 6, people who don't know about vets at all.
>> I don't think there's a group 6.  I think we're 5, yeah ... ...
[group activity]

SESSION LEADER:  So, what do you guys think?
>> We figured it all out, so it totally works.
SESSION LEADER:  Is there value in doing it this way?
>> I think so.  Even for us on number one, we're doing homeless vets, and so I don't think any of us have any like direct, you know, exposure to what that experience is like, and so trying to understand what that is, we made a bunch of assumptions, came up with a bunch much ideas and tried to be thoughtful a about what that would be, but I think it would be like super difficult.
>> We don't really know what the problem is because we don't have that experience.
>> It seems like there might have to be some interaction with other parts of organization, like marketing, maybe in a sense of like where who's the audience those things intersect with the actual demographics of your visitors are, you make this thing for homeless vets, we sort of assume, OK, they're going to the library to look at this.  How do we know that they know about the NPR website to go to the library to go and look at it.
>>
>> And I think when we do this exercise, we will probably not do homeless vets.  I imagine we will do something else.
SESSION LEADER:  That's interesting that you guys say that you don't know the experience.  You need to talk to folks, right.
>> It's a really hard problem, it made us step way outside the box in terms of our experience.
>> Yeah, I think it might also give us some questions to ask.
>> Yeah, yeah.
>> [inaudible]
SESSION LEADER:  Anyone else?
>> I think the tricky part is probably what comes next, because you're not making five separate interactives, it's when you're going to be thinking about all of these different audiences and then you try to find the intersections of what works for more than one of them.  And there probably is plenty of crossover.
>> Did anybody start thinking about like what you would actually make?
>> We did.  We thought about like, you know, like the last thing we were talking about is you all have that project about playgrounds, it's actually an ongoing resource and it's updated from time to time and it's nor homeless vets.  Potentially part of this story will be like services and local charity and whatever, and making sure those are like making a resource for them that's updated and we were trying to figure out like how they would be accessing this, that it would be running to libraries, and that probably means [inaudible]
>> Yeah, I think that's like a really good example of, you know, that group was given a really diffuse case, something we probably wouldn't pick.  It's like we're going to build a story about homeless vets for homeless vets and homeless vets don't have computers.  So we're making a thing on computers for people who don't have computers.  But then you start thinking about what they really need and they need something that helps them.  Not just tells a story, but helps them and I don't think if you just approach a story like hey, please send a photographer out to help us get homeless data, you would never come to that conclusion without doing this exercise, I don't think.  Anybody else?  You guys said you --
>> So our audience was other vets, so we thought it was not just about -- :  [inaudible] generally older male, may also run internet explorer, so we started thinking about story design and that should be linear and minimal interaction, maybe not as many opportunities to get lost in data, but maybe guide them through so they understand the parts that we want:
>> Yeah, I mean depending on your audience, it could be a tool, it could be an explainer, it could be a documentary, and I think it's, you know, it's really important to think about, because we all know this, but it's an important thing about those things, because for those of us who work at sort of national news organizations it's often like America is our audience, but that's impossible.  It's crippling, and your story is going to suffer because of it.  This has been awesome, thanks for your feedback.
>> Actually I have a question.  Did you do this exercise for the border lands thing and I'm just curious what you came up with for who's the audience for that?
>> Yeah, well, we did it for both the back data when we had it and we also did it for Steve Inskeep's radio story, and you know, basically what we decided is that it's -- it's for people who don't live in that area, and we wanted to -- and our mission was to explain that the border is like more a place than a line in the sand, so it's sort of people who don't live there.  And again, that's like a huge audience.
>>
>> Coming from a reporting and editing background, it almost feels like it would be really valuable, so like as a reporter, I wouldn't -- I might start off with these questions, but I wouldn't necessarily know what it was I was going to write at this stage.  Like going to Chris' point, I would go out and I would be asking these questions and doing interviews so I could come back and have sort of a more informed discussion about how that story gets structured and presented and I think this from that experience you'd have a better sense or your reporters and editors would have a better sense of what's the news or story we have here and which audiences is that going to resonate the most with, and then work from that angle.
>> Yeah.
>> You know, and I know that it has to be sore sort of iterative and you kind of have to be together but some of these questions aren't answerable until the reporting.
>> You're going to get something that's totally not what you thought and you should be able to go that way.
>> and I think in a lot of shops if you go too far down, you'll have others saying but we've already built we've already spent all this time there, and you might get trapped.
>> This is a before you go out in the field, let's talk about it, and then go out in the field, do whatever you have to do, and come back and let's see what you have.  Yeah.  So ...
