This summer, OpenNews will host our first-ever conferenceâ€”SRCCON, a two-day event by and for the journalism code community. In Philadelphia, we're bringing together 125  developers, interactive designers, and other people who code in and near newsrooms, to learn, plan, and build together.

We have a limited number of sponsorship spots available. Please [contact us](mailto:dan@mozillafoundation.org) for additional details.
