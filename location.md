SRCCON 2015 will be at the beautiful, spacious <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/mcnamara+alumni+center/@44.975251,-93.227871,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5f984f594ceab6ad?sa=X&ei=9qzmVISFC4iegwTskYDYCg&ved=0CIcBEPwSMBA">McNamara Alumni Center</a> on the  campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. The Alumni Center offers comfortable space for breakouts of all sizes, and will also host our evening sessions, skillshares, games, and lightning talks on the 25th.

## Lodging
We’re reserving a block of rooms at the adjoining <a href="http://www.commonshotel.com/">Commons Hotel</a>, where we have reserved a block of rooms at a base rate of $139/night. To get the special conference rate, please call 800-822-6757 or 612-379-8888 and ask for the SRCCON rate, or use our [dedicated booking link](https://gc.synxis.com/rez.aspx?Hotel=53931&Chain=11910&template=GCF&shell=GCF_4&start=availresults&arrive=6/24/2015&depart=6/27/2015&adult=1&child=0&group=062415SRCC). 

The reserved block of rooms will be available until all rooms are booked, or May 25th, whichever happens first—booking early is always at good idea.

## Childcare
We are offering free, on-site childcare available throughout the full SRCCON schedule (including Thursday evening) at the Commons Hotel via the astonishingly named but very friendly and professional [KiddieCorp](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/). The caregivers act as employees of KiddieCorp (not contractors) and are recruited from local licensed daycare centers, elementary schools, preschools, and collegiate departments of early childhood education. [Learn more about their staffing](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/staffselect.html) and [security procedures](https://www.kiddiecorp.com/security.html) on the KiddieCorp site. 

Staff-to-child ratios range from 1:2 for children 6-11months to 1:7 for children aged 6-12 years, and KiddieCorp will work with SRCCON organizers to handle registration and logistics so your kid(s) can have a great time while you're conferencing next door. 

## More Soon!

As SRCCON approaches, we'll post additional lodging information, including recommendations for other nearby options, along with restaurant, day-trip, and activity recommendations.
