Sponsors help make SRCCON happen. From scholarships that help bring a diverse collection of attendees to SRCCON, to the unique coffee and tea hacking stations that serve as the social focal point of the conference, to meals, and much more, sponsors make all of this work.

We'll be releasing a full slate of sponsorship opportunities prior to ticket on-sale, but if you want to get in early we would _love_ to talk with you.

To find out more about sponsoring SRCCON, drop a line to [Dan Sinker](mailto:dan@opennews.org).

And, to learn more about what makes SRCCON special, watch our video from last year:
