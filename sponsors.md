## Become a SRCCON sponsor

Sponsors help make SRCCON happen. From scholarships that help bring a diverse group of attendees to SRCCON, to the unique coffee and tea hacking stations that create a social focal point during the conference, to meals and much more &hellip; sponsors make all of this work.

We'll release a full slate of sponsorship opportunities before tickets go on sale, but if you want to get in early, we would _love_ to talk with you. To find out more about sponsoring SRCCON, [drop a line to Dan Sinker](mailto:dan@opennews.org).
