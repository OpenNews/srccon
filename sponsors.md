    <a href="https://www.facebookjournalismproject.com"><img src="/media/img/partners/facebook_journalism.png" alt="Facebook Journalism Project"></a>
    <p>Working together with publishers around the world through trainings, programs, and partnerships, the Facebook Journalism Project seeks to help strengthen communities by connecting people with meaningful journalism. We create strong ties with the news industry through 3 efforts. First, we build community through news, working and investing in institutes dedicated to funding high-quality journalism and building sustainable futures for community-based news. Second, we train newsrooms globally—visiting newsrooms and offering online courses to train journalists around the world on how to leverage social tools to tell stories that matter. Third, we support quality through journalism by partnering directly with news publishers and non-profit organizations to combat misinformation, promote news literacy, fund news initiatives, share best practices, and improve journalism on our platform. To stay up-to-date on our latest news, initiatives and training seminars, visit <a href="https://www.facebookjournalismproject.com">www.facebookjournalismproject.com</a> and like the Facebook Journalism Project on Facebook.</p>

    <p>The Google News Initiative is our effort to bring together everything we do as a company—across products, partnerships, and programs—to help journalism thrive in the digital age. We are focused on three key objectives: elevating quality information (which includes combating misinformation), evolving business models to support quality journalism (beyond ads to subscriptions), and empowering news organizations to use new technology (like AI) to meet their needs.</p>

    <a href="https://craignewmarkphilanthropies.org/"><img src="/media/img/partners/newmark.png" alt="Craig Newmark Philanthropies"></a>
    <p>I'm an old-school nerd, doing what I can to respect and support the people who fight to protect the values that America aspires to: fairness, opportunity and respect. I amplify the voices of the grassroots and advance their efforts to make sure everyone is included, and treated fairly and respectfully. I see my role as connecting people who are doing good, enabling them to do what they do best and then getting out of their way. I encourage others who have benefited from the many opportunities afforded by our country to give back. Because it's the right thing to do.</p>

    <a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/" class="narrow-logo"><img src="/media/img/partners/lenfest.png" alt="The Lenfest Institute"></a>
    <p>The Lenfest Institute for Journalism is the first-of-its-kind non-profit organization whose sole mission is to develop and support sustainable business models for great local journalism. The Institute was founded in 2016 by cable television entrepreneur H.F. (Gerry) Lenfest. Lenfest gifted to the Institute an initial endowment of $20 million, which has since been supplemented by other donors, for investment in innovative news initiatives, new technology, and new models for sustainable journalism. Lenfest also gifted his ownership of the Philadelphia Media Network (The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia Daily News, and philly.com, the Philadelphia region’s largest local news website) and these news properties now serve as a live lab for the Institute’s innovation efforts.</p>
