title: SRCCON Code of Conduct
---


<p class="bodybig">SRCCON and OpenNews ‬are‭ ‬committed‭ ‬to‭ ‬providing‭ ‬a‭ ‬welcoming and harassment-free environment for participants of all races, gender and trans statuses, sexual orientations, physical abilities, physical appearances, and beliefs. We've written this code of conduct not because we expect bad behavior from our community—which, in our experience, is overwhelmingly kind and civil—but because we believe a clear code of conduct is a necessary part of building a respectful community space.
</p>

SRCCON participants agree to:

* Be ‬considerate ‬in‭ ‬speech‭ ‬and‭ ‬actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.
* Refrain‭ ‬from‭ ‬demeaning,‭ ‬discriminatory,‭ ‬or‭ ‬harassing‭ ‬behavior‭ ‬and‭ ‬speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert any member of the conference team in person, via the team phone/text line, or via email.
* Take care of each other.‭ ‬Alert‭ a member of the conference‭ ‬team if‭ ‬you‭ ‬notice‭ ‬a‭ ‬dangerous‭ ‬situation,‭ ‬someone‭ ‬in‭ ‬distress,‭ ‬or‭ ‬violations‭ ‬of‭ ‬this‭ ‬code‭ ‬of‭ ‬conduct,‭ ‬even‭ ‬if‭ ‬they‭ ‬seem‭ ‬inconsequential.

**HOW TO REACH US**: Members of the conference team will be available via a single phone number (text and voice) throughout the conference, as well as in person and via email. This page will be updated before the conference begins with relevant contacts, which will also be distributed to all attendees via email and in the opening address.

If any attendee engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the conference. (If you feel you have been ‬unfairly‭ ‬accused‭ ‬of‭ ‬violating‭ ‬this‭ ‬code‭ ‬of‭ ‬conduct, you should contact the conference team with‭ ‬a‭ ‬concise‭ ‬description‭ ‬of‭ ‬your‭ ‬grievance at source@mozillafoundation.org; any grievances‬ filed will be considered by the entire OpenNews team.)

We welcome your feedback on this and every other aspect of SRCCON, and we thank you for working with us to make it a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates.
