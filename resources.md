# How We Build SRCCON Events

SRCCON conferences are two days of community connection, collaborative sessions, and a ton of documentation. As one attendee put it, _"The structure of the program and the attention to detail and people's needs is what makes this an exceptional and special event.”_

Here, we've gathered some writing about how we create these inclusive, participatory spaces. We've also gathered up several years of session documentation, and resources that inspired us from the start. If you'd like to learn more about how we organize these events, and maybe have us help out with an event of your own, [reach out](mailto:info@opennews.org)!
